/*******************************************************************************
* Function Name: main
********************************************************************************
*
* Summary:
*  The main function performs the following actions:
*   1. Waits until VBUS becomes valid and starts the USBFS component which is
*      enumerated as virtual Com port.
*   2. Waits until the device is enumerated by the host.
*   3. Waits for data coming from the hyper terminal and sends it back.
*   4. PSoC3/PSoC5LP: the LCD shows the line settings.
*
* Parameters:
*  None.
*
* Return:
*  None.
