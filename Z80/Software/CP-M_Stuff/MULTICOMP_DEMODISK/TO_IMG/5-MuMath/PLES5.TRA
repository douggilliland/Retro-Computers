%    This  is the fifth in a series  of
muSIMP programming lessons.

    In the previous lesson our original
version  of  REVERSE,   called  REVLIS,
required  time  proportional  to   n^2,
where  n  is  the length of  the  first
argument.    We   then  showed  how   a
collection  variable  or a  loop  could
yield  a  much faster  technique  using
time  proportional  only  to  n.   Now,
let's consider the speed of some of the
other set functions that we defined:

    Whether  iterative  or   recursive,
MEMBER can require a number of equality
comparisons  equal to the length of its
second   argument.    Whether   defined
iteratively  or  recursively,   SUBSET,
EQSET,   UNION,  and  INTERSECTION  all
require  a  membership  test  for  each
element  of  one argument in  the  list
which  is the  other  argument.   Thus,
these   definitions  can  all   consume
computation  time  which grows  as  the
product  of  the  lengths  of  the  two
arguments.

     By  similar  reasoning,  the  one-
argument  functions  ISSET and  MAKESET
are  seen to require time  proportional
to  the square of the length  of  their
argument.   Data-base  applications and
others  can  involve thousands  of  set
operations on sets having thousands  of
elements,  so  it is worthwhile to seek
methods for which the computation  time
grows more slowly with set size.

    In   muSIMP,   every  name  has  an
associated   PROPERTY  LIST  which   is
immediately accessible in an amount  of
time  that is independent of the  total
number  of names in use.   Provided the
elements  of  the sets are  all  names,
this  permits techniques for the  above
set    operations    requiring     time
proportional  merely  to the length  of
the  one  set  or to  the  sum  of  the
lengths of the two sets.

    A property list is a list of dotted
pairs.   The  first of each dotted pair
is  an  expression called  the  KEY  or
INDICATOR,  and the rest of each dotted
pair   is  an  expression  called   the
associated  INFORMATION.   For example,
in    a    meteorological     data-base
application,  the  name HONOLULU  might
have the property list

((RAIN . 2), (HUMIDITY . 40),
               (TEMPERATURE, 58, 96))

    The  function used in the form  GET
(name,  key)   returns the  information
which is dotted with the value of "key"
on  the property list of the  value  of
"name",  returning FALSE if no such key
occurred on the property list.

    A  command of the form  PUT  (name,
key,  information)  causes the value of
"key"   dotted   with  the   value   of
"information" to be put on the property
list  of  the  value  of  "name".   PUT
returns the value of "information".

    Using  property  lists,  the  basic
technique for accomplishing our various
operations on two sets of names is:

    1.  For each name in one of the two
sets of names, store TRUE under the key
SEEN.

    2.  For each name in the other set,
check  to determine whether or not  the
name  has  already been seen,  and  act
accordingly.

    3.  For each name in the first set,
remove  the  property SEEN so  that  we
won't    invalidate   subsequent    set
operations  which  utilize any  of  the
same elements.

    A  simpler variant of this idea  is
applicable    to    the    one-argument
functions named ISSET and MAKESET.

    As  an  example,   here  is   UNION
defined  using this technique  together
with the applicative style:  %

FUNCTION UNION (SET1, SET2),
  MARK (SET1),
  UNMARK (SET1, UNIONAUX (SET2))   ENDFUN $
FUNCTION MARK (SET1),
  WHEN EMPTY (SET1),  EXIT,
  PUT (FIRST(SET1), 'SEEN, TRUE),
  MARK (REST (SET1))   ENDFUN $
FUNCTION UNIONAUX (SET2),
  WHEN EMPTY (SET2),  SET1  EXIT,
  WHEN GET (FIRST(SET2), 'SEEN),  UNIONAUX (REST(SET2))  EXIT,
  ADJOIN (FIRST(SET2), UNIONAUX(REST(SET2)))   ENDFUN $
FUNCTION UNMARK (SET1, ANS),
  WHEN EMPTY (SET1),  ANS  EXIT,
  PUT (FIRST(SET1), 'SEEN, FALSE),
  UNMARK (REST(SET1), ANS)   ENDFUN $
UNION ('(A, B, C, D), '(F, A, E, C)) &
%    Each time any function is invoked,
the  outside  values of  its  parameter
names, if any, are "stacked" away to be
restored  later,  just prior to  return
from  that invocation.   If a  function
refers to a variable which is not among
its  parameters,  then the most  recent
value  of the variable on the stack  is
used.

     Thus,  when  UNIONAUX  is  invoked
from   within   UNION,   SET1  in   the
definition  of UNIONAUX refers  to  the
argument  value  associated  with  that
parameter of UNION.   This treatment is
called   "dynamic   binding",   and   a
reference  such as to SET1 in  UNIONAUX
is called a "fluid reference".

     We  could  have  avoided  this  by
making  SET1  be  an  argument  and   a
parameter  to UNIONAUX,  but that would
have  made the program slightly  slower
and   more   bulky.    However,   fluid
variables make programs much harder  to
debug   and  maintain,   especially  if
assignments   are  made  to   them   in
functions  other  than the  ones  which
establish   them.    Consequently,   we
recommend   generally  avoiding   fluid
variables.  The only reason we used one
here  is  to introduce the  concept  to
issue this advice.

    Values assigned at the top-level of
muSIMP,     outside     all    function
definitions,  are called GLOBAL values.
Examples  are  the  initial  values  of
muSIMP  control variables such  as  RDS
and   ECHO,   or   of  muMATH   control
variables  such  as PBRCH  or  PWREXPD.

     Reference  to a global value  from
within  a  function definition  is  not
quite  as confusing as reference  to  a
fluid  value,  and it is indeed onerous
to   create  numerous  long  lists   of
parameters   in  order  to  pass   such
environmental control values through  a
long  sequence of function  definitions
for use deep within.

    The property-list technique for set
operations  is  one which we  think  is
more  naturally  implemented using  the
Von Neumann programming style.   Try to
write  such  a  version  of  UNION:   %
RDS: FALSE $
%   Now,  using either style,  write an
INTERSECTION    function   using    the
property-list technique:  %RDS: FALSE $
%  Taking the FIRST and/or REST  of  an
atom is generally not necessary, but it
does in fact have a well-defined value.
The FIRST cell of an atom points to the
atom's  value,   while  the  REST  cell
points  to the property list associated
with the atom.  For example: %

WEATHER: 'FOUL $
PUT ('WEATHER, 'TEMPERATURE, -3) $
PUT ('WEATHER, 'WIND, '((NORTH . WEST), 30)) $
FIRST (WEATHER) &
REST ('WEATHER) &
%    Integer atoms also have FIRST  and
REST  cells.   The  FIRST  cell  of  an
integer normally points to the  integer
itself.   The  REST  cell  is  used  to
determine  the sign of the number:   if
FALSE the integer is  non-negative,  if
TRUE the integer is negative. %

FIRST (7) &
REST (7) &
NINE: 9 $
PUT (NINE, 'TESTING, '(1, 2, 3)) &
GET (NINE, 'TESTING) &
GET (9, 'TESTING) &
%  All muSIMP data objects (i.e. nodes,
names,  and integers) have a FIRST cell
and a REST cell which can only point to
valid   muSIMP  data  objects.    Thus,
misuse   of  these   selectors   cannot
accidently   give  access  to  non-data
objects such as machine language  code,
stack,  print names,  etc.  This closed
pointer    universe   guarantees    the
integrity   of  muSIMP  from   possible
excursions into the unknown.

    It  is common practice to use EMPTY
to  test  for the end  condition  as  a
function proceeds down a list.  If such
a  function  is inadvertently  given  a
non-list  (i.e.  a Non-FALSE atom or  a
structure  whose final REST cell points
to a Non-FALSE atom), the function will
use  the FIRST cell of that atom  (i.e.
its  Value cell) as an element  of  the
list  and  the  REST cell of  the  atom
(i.e.  its  Property List cell) as  the
REST  of  the  list.    Generally   the
Property List is a well defined list so
the  EMPTY  test will ultimately  cause
termination with no ill affects.

       We   prefer  to  have   non-list
arguments give more predictable results
confined to the  argument.   Thus,  our
internal   implementations  of  MEMBER,
REVERSE,   and   any  other   functions
ordinarily  applied to lists  use  ATOM
rather  than  EMPTY as the  termination
test.   This is slightly faster too, so
you  may wish to generally avoid  EMPTY
in favor of ATOM.   Alternatively,  you
can redefine EMPTY to print and  return
an  error message when given a nonFALSE
atom: %

FUNCTION EMPTY (LIS),
  WHEN ATOM (LIS),
    WHEN LIS EQ FALSE EXIT,
    PRINT ("*** Warning: EMPTY given nonlist ")  EXIT
ENDFUN $
EMPTY (5) $
%     This   is   our   first   example
illustrating the fact that  conditional
exits  can be nested arbitrarily  deep.
The  same  is true of loops or  blocks.
This example also illustrates the PRINT
function, which prints its one argument
the    same   way   that    expressions
terminated   with  an   ampersand   are
printed.    There   is   an   analogous
function named PRTMATH which prints its
one   argument   the  same   way   that
expressions terminated with a semicolon
are printed.

    When   functions  are  called  with
fewer   actual   arguments   than   the
function  has  formal  arguments,   the
remaining formal arguments are assigned
the  value  FALSE.    This  provides  a
convenient mechanism for  automatically
inserting   default  values  for  these
extra  arguments.    When  an  argument
evaluates  to FALSE,  the function  can
assign  the appropriate default  value.
For  example,  if  the user  omits  the
drive  as  the third argument  of  RDS,
that function uses the currently logged
in drive (i.e.  the drive indicated  by
the  last operating system prompt given
before entering muSIMP).

     There  are instances where  it  is
desirable  to permit a function to have
an arbitrary number of arguments.  This
is  accomplished by making  the  formal
parameter list of a function definition
be  an  atom or non-list rather than  a
list.   The arguments are passed to the
function  as a single list of  argument
values,  from  which the  function  can
extract the values.  For example, it is
convenient to have a function named MAX
which  returns  the largest of  one  or
more argument values.  We can implement
this as follows:  %

FUNCTION MAX ARGLIS,
  MAXAUX (FIRST(ARGLIS), REST(ARGLIS))
ENDFUN $
FUNCTION MAXAUX (BIGGEST, UNTRIED),
  WHEN EMPTY (UNTRIED),  BIGGEST  EXIT,
  WHEN BIGGEST > FIRST(UNTRIED), MAXAUX (BIGGEST, REST(UNTRIED)) EXIT,
  MAXAUX (FIRST(UNTRIED), REST(UNTRIED))
ENDFUN $
MAX (7) ;
MAX (3, 8, -2) ;
%   This collection of arguments into a
list is called NOSPREAD, to distinguish
from the SPREAD brand of peanut butter.

    Now,  suppose  that for some reason
we already have a list of integers such
as  %

NUMBLIS: '(18, 3, 7, 91, 12, 2) $
%   and we want to find their  maximum.
The  expression MAX (NUMBLIS) will  not
work,   because  MAX  is  designed  for
numeric  arguments,  not for a list  of
numbers.   We  could of course  extract
the elements and feed them individually
to MAX, but this is awkward, especially
if  we  are referring to MAX  inside  a
function  and  we do not know ahead  of
time how many integers are in  NUMBLIS.

     Fortunately there is a  convenient
function named APPLY, which applies the
function whose name is the value of its
first  argument  to the  argument  list
which   is  the  value  of  its  second
argument.  Consequently, we need merely
write %

APPLY ('MAX, NUMBLIS) &
%    APPLY  works on either  SPREAD  or
NOSPREAD functions.   Why don't you try
out  a few examples:   %RDS: FALSE $
%    A  function written in  muSIMP  is
stored  internally  in a  very  compact
form called D-code (see Section 13.9 of
the muMATH Reference Manual).  In order
to  retrieve the definition for use  as
data,    the    function   GETD    (GET
Definition) of one argument can be used
to decompile the definition and  return
it  is  as a linked list.   If GETD  is
given the name of a primitively defined
machine language routine  instead,  the
physical  memory address of the routine
is returned.   Finally, if its argument
is not a defined function, GETD returns
returns FALSE.   The following examples
show  the result of all three types  of
arguments:  %

GETD ('UNION) &  GETD ('FIRST) &  GETD ('FOO) &
%   Since function definitions  can  be
converted    into   lists   and    then
recompiled  back into D-code,  a muSIMP
program can actuately be made to modify
muSIMP  functions!   In fact,  this  is
exactly  what  the  TRACE  and  UNTRACE
commands  do  to the  traced  function.
Other  examples  which could  use  this
feature   include  a  muSIMP   function
editor  and  pretty  printer,  a  cross
reference program,  and even a compiler
all  of  which  could  be  written   in
muSIMP.

    This  is  the  end  of  programming
lesson  5.   These lessons should  have
provided  you with sufficient knowledge
to be able to use the muSIMP Section of
the  Reference  Manual to  achieve  any
desired muSIMP programming goal. %
