MUMATH%.DOC   documentation for the muMATH files on this disk

These files are to be used with the muMATH/muSIMP symbolic
mathematics system.  I will assume that anyone reading this
has at least a minimal familiarity with that system.  The
files have been named according to the usual muSIMP scheme to
display their dependences upon each other.  Most of the files
are intended as enhancements or replacements for files fur-
nished with muMATH.  I recommend that you keep the original
files and give the new files different names, since you may
sometimes want to use the old version instead of the new one.

These files will allow many calculations to be done that could
not be done with the original muMATH release.  When PBRCH is
non-false (so that picking a branch for a multi-valued function
is expected), the calculation of #I^(2/3) as 1/2 + 3^(1/2)*#I/2
can be carried out.  Formulas for the solution of third and
fourth degree equations are included.  Exact values of many
more of the trig functions can be obtained; for example
COS(#PI/16) and SIN(11*#PI/15).  Evaluation of the inverse
trig functions are included, so that calculations like
DEFINT(1/(1+X^2),X,MINF,PINF)  can be done (answer: #PI).
Also,values for the error function have been added, so that
DEFINT(#E^-X^2,X,MINF,PINF) can be calculated.  Many of the
most common infinite series can be evaluated.

Most of the files furnished here cannot be loaded as-is by
muSIMP.  I have included the character `%' in the names of
such files: muSIMP will not load a file containing it unless
the % is doubled.  Instructions for creating a RDS-able file
from the %-file are contained at the beginning of the file.
Normally this is involves merging the file with one of the old
muMATH files, using a text editor.

Descriptions of the new files and/or the differences in the
new versions are given below.  I have included many
calculator-mode examples.  When you have loaded a new file,
I recommend that you try at least a couple of the examples for
that file to make sure it is working properly.

I would be interested in hearing from other users of muMATH,
especially those who have written programs to do non-trivial
mathematical tasks.  My address:  Gerald Edgar, 107 W. Dodridge
St., Columbus, OH 43202.  Perhaps we can exchange programs
(hard copy form, or even on disk - 8" CP/M only, please).

============================================================
ARITH.MUS

This file is a replacement for the existing ARITH.MUS.  The
only difference is in evaluation of powers #I^R when PBRCH
is non-false and the exponent is rational.  In that case,
#I^R is replaced by a complex exponential.  Example:

     ? #I^(2/3);
     @: #E ^ (#I*#PI/3)

     ? TRGEXPD: -7;
     @: -7

     ? #I^(2/3);
     @: #I*SIN(#PI/3) + COS(#PI/3)

With TRGNEG, we get:

     ? #I^(2/3);
     @: 1/2 + 3^(1/2)*#I/2
     

============================================================
SOLVE4.EQN

The file SOLVE4.EQN replaces SOLVE.EQN.  It was constructed by
adding the formulas for third and fourth degree equations to
SOLVE.EQN.  Usage is the same as described in the manual.  (In
some of the following examples, the new version of ARITH.MUS
has made a difference.)

     ? SOLVE(9*X^3-3*X^2-8*X+4==0,X);
     @: {X == -1,
         X == 2/3+5*#I/(3^(1/2)*6)-3^(1/2)*5*#I/18}

     ? EXPD(@);
     @: {X == -1,
         X == 2/3}

     ? EXPD((X-1)*(X-2)*(X-3)*(X-4));
     @: 24 - 50*X + 35*X^2 - 10*X^3 + X^4

     ? SOLVE(@,X);
     @: {X == 4,
         X == 1,
         X == 3,
         X == 2}

     ? EXPD((X-1)*(X+1)*(X+3));
     @: -3 - X + 3*X^2 + X^3

     ? SOLVE(@,X);
     @: {X == -1+6/(3^(3/2)*#E^(#I*#PI/6))+2*#E^(#I*#PI/6)/
     3^(1/2),
         X == -1-1/(3^(1/2)*#E^(#I*#PI/6))-#E^(#I*#PI/6)/
     3^(1/2)+#I/#E^(#I*#PI/6)-#E^(#I*#PI/6)*#I,
         X == -1-1/(3^(1/2)*#E^(#I*#PI/6))-#E^(#I*#PI/6)/
     3^(1/2)-#I/#E^(#I*#PI/6)+#E^(#I*#PI/6)*#I}

     ? TRGEXPD(@,-7);
     @: {X == 1-#I/3^(1/2)+#I/3^(1/2),
         X == -1,
         X == -3}

     ? EXPD(@);
     @: {X == 1,
         X == -1,
         X == -3}

Of course, this last example used file TRGNEG.ALG for the
evaluation of the complex exponentials.

This file is not as useful as you might expect at first.  I
must admit that the above examples are contrived so that they
will look good.  To see an example where the formulas do not
work well, try EXPD((X-1)*(X-2)*(X+4)); and then SOLVE(@,X);
Can you get muMATH to simplify these roots to  1, 2, and -4 ?
Can you even tell which root is 1 ?


============================================================
TRGNEG.ALG

This is a replacement for the existing TRGNEG.ALG.  Exact
evaluation of many more functions is now possible.  SIN and COS
of rational multiples of #PI, where the denominator is a power
of 2 possibly multiplied by 3 or 5 (or both) are included.
These are cases that can be evaluated using only square roots.
(I have not included all such angles that are theoretically
possible, such as #PI/17 and #PI/65537.)  Examples:

     ? DENNUM: -6;
     @: -6

     ? COS(2*#PI/5);
     @: -1/4 + 5^(1/2)/4

     ? COS(#PI/16);
     @: (2^(3/4)+(1+2^(1/2))^(1/2))^(1/2) / 2^(7/8)

     ? SIN(11*#PI/15);
     @: (7-5^(1/2)+(30-5^(1/2)*6)^(1/2))^(1/2) / 4


============================================================
ATRG.TRG

This file handles inverse trigonometric functions.  It depends
on TRGNEG.ALG.

The functions in this file are:

     ASIN(X)     arc sine of X
     ACOS(X)     arc cosine of X
     ATAN(X)     arc tangent of X
     ACOT(X)     arc cotangent of X
     ASEC(X)     arc secant of X
     ACSC(X)     arc cosecant of X

Firstly, if PBRCH is non-false, these functions are all written
in terms of ASIN and ATAN.  Example:

     ? ACOS(U);
     @: #PI/2 - ASIN(U)

Certain elementary reductions are carried out:

     ? ATAN(TAN(U));
     @: U

     ? ACOS(SIN(X));
     @: #PI/2 - X

Inverse trig functions are evaluated in a few cases.  (I
have essentially just included a list of the cases in the
program, probably not a very good algorithm.)

     ? ASIN(1/2);
     @: #PI / 6

     ? ASEC(2^(1/2));
     @: #PI / 4

     ? ATAN(MINF);
     @: -#PI / 2

This is useful in connection with some of the other files:

     ? DEFINT(1/(1+X+X^2),X,-1/2,0);
     @: #PI / 3^(3/2)

     ? DEFINT(1/(1+X^2),X,MINF,PINF);
     @: #PI

This feature is helpful also with SERIES.DIF, described below.

When TRGEXPD is a positive multiple of 7, inverse trigonometric
functions are converted to expressions involving logarithms:

     ? ATAN(U);
     @: ATAN (U)

     ? TRGEXPD(@,7);
     @: #I*LN((#I+U)/(#I-U)) / 2

The reverse transformation is described below in file LOG.ALG.


============================================================
LOG.ALG

This file contains only one new feature.  I can't think of a
situation in which to use it; I have included it only because
it is the logical reverse of a feature of ATRG.TRG, above.

In file ATRG, inverse trig functions are replaced by logarithms
when TRGEXPD is a positive multiple of 7.  In this file, the
reverse can be done.  If TRGEXPD is a negative multiple of
7, then natural logarithms are converted to inverse trig
functions.  Example:

     ? A:LOG(U);
     @: LN(U)

     ? TRGEXPD: -7;
     @: -7

     ? EVAL(A);
     @: 2 * #I * ATAN((#I-#I*U)/(1+U))


============================================================
INT.DIF and LIM.DIF

There are minor changes in these files to take into account
the error function ERF.  Examples:

     ? ERF(0);
     @: 0

     ? ERF(MINF);
     @: -1

The following example is done with INT.DIF, INTMORE.INT,
LIM.DIF, and LOG.ALG (for those with a lot of memory):

     ? DEFINT(#E^-X^2,X,MINF,PINF);
     @: #PI ^ (1/2)


============================================================
SERIES.DIF

This file is a replacement for the existing file SIGMA.ALG.
Usage of SIGMA and PROD are as described in the manual.  The
file has been completely rewritten.  Notice that SERIES
requires DIF.ALG and is larger than SIGMA.  All of the series
that SIGMA can do and several of the most common infinite
series can be summed.

The program may ask questions in the manner of LIM in order to
determine which method to use or to determine whether a series
converges.  The files LOG.ALG, TRGNEG.ALG, and ATRG.TRG may be
useful with this file.  Some of the examples below were done
with the help of these additional files.

     ? SIGMA(N^2*3^N,N,1,K);
     @: -3/2 + 3^(1+K)*K + 3^(1+K)*K^2/2 - 3^(2+K)*K/2 +
     3^(1+K)/2 - 3^(3+K)/4 + 3^(3+K)/4

     ? SIGMA((-1)^N*X^(2*N+1)/(2*N+1)!,N,0,PINF);
     @:
     ???  - X^2  ???
     ENTER SIGN (0 + -)? -
      SIN(X)

     ? SIGMA(2^N/(4*N-1)!,N,3,PINF);
     @: -421/1260 - SIN(2^(1/4))/2^(3/4) - 2^(1/4)/(4*
     #E^2^(1/4)) + 2^(1/4)*#E^2^(1/4)/4

     ? SIGMA((-1)^N/N,N,1,PINF);
     @: - LN(2)

     ? SIGMA(X^N/(2*N+3),N,1,PINF);
     @:
     ???  1 + X  ???
     ENTER SIGN (0 + -)? +

     ???  1 - X  ???
     ENTER SIGN (0 + -)? +

     ???  X  ???
     ENTER SIGN (0 + -)? +
      -1/3 - LN(1-X^(1/2))/(2*X^(3/2)) + LN(1+X^(1/2))/(2*
     X^(3/2)) - 1/X

     ? SIGMA((-1)^N/(3*N+1),N,1,PINF);
     @: -1 + #PI/3^(3/2) + LN(2)/3

     ? SIGMA(N^2/((2*N+1)*4^N),N,0,PINF);
     @: -1/9 + LN(3/2)/4 - LN(1/2)/4

     ? LOGEXPD(@,30);
     @: -1/9 + LN(3)/4

Without LOG.ALG:

     ? SIGMA(N*X^N/N!,N,0,PINF);
     @: #E^X * X * LOG(#E,#E)

Try this one to see an impressive-looking answer:

     ? SIGMA((-1)^N/(5*N+2),N,0,PINF);
 

============================================================

In addition to these descriptions, let me list a few bugs (or
misprints - the distinction is a bit fuzzy here) in muMATH
(at least in version 2.12).

1.  In file DIF.ALG, in the function beginning

          PROPERTY DIF, DEFINT,

    the line just before ENDFUN should end

                        EVSUB(EX1,EX2,EX3),

    For example,

         ? DIF( DEFINT(F(T),T,X,0), X );

    should yield

         @: -F(X)

    not

         @: -F(T)

2.  In file LIM.DIF, in the function beginning

          PROPERTY LIM, !,

    (near the end of the file), the second line should
    contain

          EX1:LIM1(EX1,#LIM),

    rather than

          EX1:LIM(EX1,#LIM),

3.  Also in file LIM.DIF, the handling of LIM with only one
    argument supplied is not as specified in the manual.
    For example, try the following:

          ? LIM(R+S);
          @: ?

          ? LIM((X-X^2)/(1-X));
          @: 0

    If you get these (wrong) answers, here is a fix: In
    FUNCTION LIM , move the four lines between BLOCK and
    ENDBLOCK (inclusive) to the beginning (just before
    `LOGBAS: #E,') and then just after these four lines
    (still before `LOGBAS: #E,') add a new line:

          WHEN NOT INDET, LIM1(EX1,#LIM)  EXIT,

    Now you should get the correct answers:

          ? LIM(R+S);
          @: R + S

          ? LIM((X-X^2)/(1-X));
          @: (X-X^2) / (1-X)

4.  This one is not really a bug, but it will speed up LIM
    involving exponents when LOG.ALG is not loaded.  In
    FUNCTION LIM , change

          LOGEXPD: 70,

    to

          LOGEXPD: 10,

    then in PROPERTY LIM, ^, at the beginning (just after the
    comment % Fluid vars ... % ) add five new lines:

          BLOCK
            WHEN FREE(EX3,INDET) OR FREE(EX4,INDET),
              EX2:EX4, EX1:EX3  EXIT,
            EX2:EX4*LOG(EX3,#E), EX1:#E,
          ENDBLOCK,

    and finally change the next-to-last line (just before
    ENDFUN) from

          EX1^EX2,

    to

          LIM1(EX3,#LIM)^LIM1(EX4,#LIM),


5.  In the manual, page 9-4, item 4. near the top of the
    page, the second sentence should begin

          When TRGEXPD is a negative multiple of 7,

    The correct information is given on page 9-28.
