     Commands in utility packs for  the  most  part  have  a
consistent command syntax.    Each  command  consists  of  a
command name followed  by  arguments.    The  arguments  are
separated by spaces (not tabs).  If spaces are desired in an
argument, they  must  be  placed  in  double  quotes.    The
arguments tend to be  options,  filenames,  or  input/output
redirections.  The options are preceded by a dash  ('-')  in
most cases.  Filenames must be unambiguous ('?' and '*'  are
not treated specially).  
     These command make use of  a  "standard  input"  and  a
"standard  output."  Normally,   the   standard   input   is
equivalent to the console keyboard and the  standard  output
is equivalent to console output.  However, these assignments
can  be  changed  by  adding  an  input/output   redirection
argument to the command line.  If an argument  of  the  form
>filen is added to the command line, the standard output  is
changed to filen.  If an argument  of  the  form  <filen  is
added to the command line, the standard input is changed  to
filen.  (These arguments  must  be  preceded  by  a  space).
     Ambiguous file specifications are not (as yet) accepted
by any utility command.  Also  there  is  no  provision  for
redirection the standard input/output to a  device  such  as
PRN:  .  
     The commands in the utility pack is  described  in  the
following pages.  Each command is given  in  synopsis  form,
with square  brackets  ('['  and  ']')  indicating  optional
forms.  Upper case forms in the synopses are  typed  by  the
user exactly as they appear.  Lower case  forms  are  to  be
replace by some item such as a filename.  
     There are several inconveniences associated  with  CP/M
command line processing that affect utility  packs:    first
command lines are forced into upper case,  making  entry  of
lower case impossible; second, command lines are limited  to
a mere 126 bytes; third, the maximum number of arguments  is

        CAT -- Concatenate files. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        CAT [ - ] [ filename ] ... 
 
     CAT concatenates the named files.  If a minus ('-')  is
specified  the  standard  input  is  read.    Control-Z   is
considered end of file.

Synopsis: 
 
        DATE [ date_string ] 
 
     DATE displays or sets the date string contained in file
'DATE.DTE'.  The date string is entered into  'DATE.DTE'  as
the new system date.  If date_string is  absent,  DATE  will
display the infomation found in 'DATE.DTE' up to  the  first
Control-Z.  If 'DATE.DTE' does not exist DATE  will  display
'00/00/00'.  No format testing is done  on  date_string,  so
any string is allowed as the date.

        DC -- On-line desk calculator. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        DC 
 
     DC is a thirteen BCD digit, floating  point  arithmetic
calculator.  
     DC accepts  commands  from  the  standard  input  after
prompting with a '>'.  Input to  DC  is  in  Reverse  Polish
Notation.  
     The following is a list of DC commands:  

        <number>        - Push number onto stack. 
        'h' or 'H'      - Display online help. 
        'l'nn or 'L'nn  - Pop top of stack into register nn. 
        'p'             - Display top of stack. 
        'P'             - Display top of stack and pop. 
        'q' or 'Q'      - Leave DC. 
        's' or 'S'      - Swap top two stack elements. 
        'w'nn or 'W'nn  - Push register nn onto stack. 
        'x' or 'X'      - Display entire stack. 
        'z' or 'Z'      - Clear stack. 
        '$'             - Extended function flag (see below). 
        <carriage ret.> - Start processing. 
 
     The following is the list of basic mathematic functions
that DC performs.  These functions operate  by  popping  the
top two stack elements, performing the operation,  and  then
pushing the result back onto the stack.  

        '+'             - Addition. 
        '-'             - Subtraction. 
        '*'             - Multiplication. 
        '/'             - Divison. 













        '%%'            - Modulus. 
        '^'             - Exponentiation by an integer. 
 
     There is also a set of extended math functions.   These
functions  are  accessed  by  first  entering  the  extended
function flag ('$') and then the  function  name.    All  of
these functions pop the top element of  the  stack,  compute
the result,  and  push  the  result  back  onto  the  stack.
     All of the functions, except for 'I', approximate their
result by evaluating a power or  taylor  series  in  "single
precision," so it is possible for some results  to  be  less
precise than thirteen digits.  All  trigonometric  functions
return radians.  
     The functions and their names are:  

        'a' or 'A'      - Compute the natural antilog. 
        'c' or 'C'      - Compute the cosine (radians). 
        'i' or 'I'      - Compute the integer part. 
        'l' or 'L'      - Compute the natural log. 
        'q' or 'Q'      - Compute the square root. 
        's' or 'S'      - Compute the sine (radians). 
        't' or 'T'      - Compute the tangent (radians). 
        '!'             - Factoral. 
 
     The  following  functions  are   also   extended   math
functions, and are  accessed  the  same  way,  they  however
operate on the top two  stack  elements.    These  functions
return  '1.000000000000'  if  the  expression  is  true  and
'0.000000000000' if false.  

        '<'             - Less than. 
        '>'             - Greater than. 
        '<='            - Less than or equal to. 
        '>='            - Greater than or equal to. 
        '='             - Equal. 
        '#'             - Not equal. 
 
     Up to eighty characters may be entered on  the  command













line at a time.  Numbers must be terminated by a space or  a
command.

        DIFF -- Compare two files line by line. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        DIFF [ -A ] file1 file2 
 
     DIFF does a line by line comparison of file1 and file2.
If a line is found in file1 but not in  file2  the  line  is
displayed, prefaced by '^*' on the standard  output  device.
The line is displayed, prefaced by '^.' if in file2 but  not
file1.  If  option  -A  is  selected  all  other  lines  are
displayed, prefaced by '^ '.  
Note: 
     DIFF reads the file into memory.   If  the  file  won't
fit, DIFF dies.  In order to make this less  of  a  problem,
DIFF is supplied in four versions:  DIFF.COM (24k  version),
which handles  2,000  lines  and  10,000  bytes  of  source;
DIFF32.COM (32k version),  which  handles  3,000  lines  and
17,000 bytes; DIFF48.COM (48k version), which handles  4,000
lines and 24,000 bytes; and DIFF56.COM (56k version),  which
handles 5,000 lines  and  31,000  bytes.    (Subtract  0E00h
(about 4k) from these figures to get the required TPA size).  
     SPLIT can also be used to keep DIFF alive.

        INUSE -- Reserve a terminal. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        INUSE 
 
     INUSE clears the terminal screen and displays 'IN  USE'
in large letters across the  screen.    INUSE  ends  on  any
keystroke.  
     INUSE should request a password to prevent unauthorized
access to the terminal.    However,  under  CP/M,  control-C
cannot  be  ignored  by  a  program   waiting   for   input.
     INUSE does not use IO redirection.  



































 
 
        PR -- Output formatter. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        PR [ -Lnn -Wnn -nn -T -PR -PU -Hstring1 ] [ filen ... ] 
 
     PR prints the list of files on the standard output with
optional header/trailer lines.  The header contains  a  page
number, the filename of the  file  being  printed,  and  the
date_string (if present--see DATE).   PR  expands  tabs  and
form  feeds  using  the  appropriate   linefeed   or   space
characters.  
     -Wnn sets the line length to nn (default is 79).   -Lnn
sets the page length to nn (default is 66).  -nn causes  the
output to be formatted into nn columns (default is 1).    -T
deletes the header/trailer lines.  -PR sends the  output  to
the printer device.  -PU  sends  the  output  to  the  punch
device.  -Hstring1 substitutes string1 for the  filename  in
the header.

        RPL -- Substitute strings. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        RPL string1 string2 file1 ... 
 
     RPL replaces all occurences of string1 with string2  in
the list of files.  The original of  each  file  is  renamed
using the extension of '.BAK'.  


Bugs: 
     IO redirection  is  not  available.    Files  with  the
extension of '.BAK' cannot be specified to RPL.

        SLEEP -- Pause. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        SLEEP nn 
 
     SLEEP executes for nn time units (a time  unit  is  one
second on a 4MHz system).  This is useful in a 'submit' file
when a pause for operator interaction  is  needed,  such  as
when a disk needs to be mounted, or forms need to be changed
in a printer.  





































 
 
        SPLIT -- Split a file. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        SPLIT [ -nn ] file1 
 
     SPLIT copies file1 into multiple files of  one  hundred
lines each.  These files are names  XAA,  XAB,  and  so  on.
     If -nn is specified, the file is split at multiples  of
nn lines.  
     A maximum of 26 files will be created.

        TR -- Translate bytes. 
 
 
Synopsis: 
 
        TR string1 string2 file1 [ file2 ...] 
 
     TR performs a byte by byte translation.    string1  and
string2 are made up of ASCII characters or '\'  followed  by
three decimal digits which will be taken to be  the  decimal
value of the byte's code.  string2 must at least contain  as
many byte values as  string1.    '\\'  represents  a  single
slash, and '\F' indicates that the rest of the string is  to
be taken as the name of a file to read in order to form  the
translation information.  The file is taken to contain pairs
of strings:  each a string1-string2 pair, carriage  returns,
line  feeds,  spaces,  tabs,  and  control-Z's  are   string
separators.  
     In the following example 'A' is  translated  into  'Z',
byte code 5 into byte code 6, and byte code 10 into 'P'  for
the files 'TEST1.DAT' and 'TEST2.DAT'.  
     Note that the command line processing of CP/M  requires
that lower case ASCII characters be entered to  TR  via  the
'\' escape convention.  
 
TR A\005\010 Z\006p TEST1.DAT TEST2.DAT 
 
     Byte codes must be 3 digits long, padded  with  leading
zeros if necessary.  Valid byte codes run  from  0  to  255.
     Note that text files usually are padded at the end with
control-Z's, therefore translating control-Z produces  files
that are hard to manipulate  with  standard  CP/M  programs.


Bugs: 
     IO redirection  is  not  available.    Files  with  the













extension of '.BAK' cannot be specified to RPL.
