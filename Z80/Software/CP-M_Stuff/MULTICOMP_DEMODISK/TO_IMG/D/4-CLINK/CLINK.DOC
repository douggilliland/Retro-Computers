User's manual for CLINK Version 3.0
 
   CLINK is a CP/M transient program which allows the owner of a CP/M
system with a D.C. Hayes 80-103A modem to establish a communications
link to a wide variety of remote devices, such as:
 
     1) commercial timesharing services
     2) university computing centers
     3) "community bulliten board" systems
     4) "remote console" hobbyist systems
     5) other CP/M users runnning CLINK
 
The only restrictions on type of remote devices are:
 
     1) must be 110 or 300 baud asynchronous
     2) must be Bell 103A compatible
     3) must be "teletype" environment
 
All other characteristics which may vary from site to site are user
programmable in a very simple manner.
 
   Bringing up CLINK in your own CP/M system is as simple as making a
copy on one of your own diskettes and running it. All console and disk
I/O is done via BIOS and BDOS calls. All modem I/O is done via the
"standard" 80-103A addresses (80H,81H,82H). This device independence
has caused one restriction: the (effective) baud rate of the console
device must be much greater (4x or more) than the selected baud rate
of the modem. This is normally no problem, but simple changes can be
made (which make CLINK device-dependent) to allow use of a console
which runs at the same baud rate as the modem. This requires a good
working knowledge of 8080 assembly language.
 
   Some background information on data communications is necessary
before proceeeding to the detailed description of the available
directives. Several good books are available which cover the subject
very well, starting at a level that the typical hobbyist should be able
to follow with little or no difficulty. Two of the best are:
 
     1) Signetics Data Communications Handbook ($3.50)
        Signetics Corp. / P.O. Box 9052 / Sunnyvale Ca 94086
 
     2) Technical Aspects of Data Communication ($17.95)
        John McNamara / Digital Equipment Corporation
 
The following makes no attempts to cover all the information in the
above volumes, but should be sufficient to allow intelligent use of
most of the options available in CLINK.
 
   The "Data Communications" field has evolved from simple beginnings
in the days of teletype loops into a fairly complex set of conventions
and standards for allowing various devices (terminals, modems, computers,
the phone system, etc) to be hooked together so that data may be
transferred from one point to another. Like any complex technical field
data communications has its own unique terminology. Some of these terms
will be defined in this manual.
 
Parallel Digital Data - simultaneous transmission of an entire byte (or
machine word) using two-state voltage levels, usually in conjunction
with "handshaking" signals, such as "data available", etc. The link 
between the S100 bus and the UART on the 80-103A is "parallel".
 
Serial Digital Data - time-multiplexed data on a single line, such that
the various bits that make up a byte are placed on the line, one after
another, until all bits have had their "time-slice". The link between
the UART and the modem on the 80-103A is "serial".
 
Asynchronous Serial - one set of conventions for time-multiplexing
data. Allows the data to occur at sporadic intervals, up to some 
maximum frequency. Basically, this allows an arbitrarily long interval
to elapse from the end of one character to the start of the next. 
Typical of situations where a human is involved (who can not be expected
to continuously type, or read, a fixed number of characters per second).
Requires overhead information on each character to indicate "start of
character" and "return to idle line". Not very demanding of timing,
typically within 5%. Used in relativly low speed environments (75 to
9600 baud). The link between the UART and the modem on the 80-103A is
digital asynchronous serial.
 
Synchronous Serial - another set of conventions for time multiplexing
data. Requires the data to occur at fixed intervals (determined by bit
rate). Basically as soon as one character has ended, the next must
immediately begin (no gap between). Typical of machine to machine links.
Requires timing information (clocks) alongside serial data. No overhead
is required on each byte, just one or more "synchronization" bytes at 
the start of a block of data to establish where the "byte" boundaries
are within the continuous bit stream. Typically used in relatively high
speed environments (1200 to 56K baud). Very little hardware (or software
for that matter) is currently available on the hobbyist market which can
support this technique (exception: IMSAI SIO2 I/O board).
 
UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter. Single LSI chip
capable of simultaneously serializing (parallel to serial) and/or
deserializing (serial to parallel) asynchronous serial data. One of the
basic building blocks of many communications systems. Ususally allows
selection of details of the conversion process, such as number of data
bits, number of stop bits, etc. The 80-103A has a fairly typical UART,
and provisions for controlling the various options in software, by
outputting 1's or 0's to particular bits in control registers.
 
Data bits - the number of non-overhead bits in each asynchronous
character. Typically seven for most commercial timesharing services.
For special purposes, such as using 8-bit codes like EBCDIC, or
transferring 8-bit data (such as object code, compressed text, etc)
this may be extended to eight.
 
Stop bits - the number of bit-times that the line is guaranteed to
remain in the "mark" state (logic 1) after a given asynchronous
character. For 110 baud, this is usually two. For all other conditions,
one is almost always sufficient and yields higher throughput.
 
Parity bit - an error detection mechanism used in most asynchronous
communication systems. Basically, one additional bit is appended 
after the data bits, but before the stop bit(s). If using "even" parity,
this bit will be chosen so that the total number of "on" (logic 1) bits
in the data+parity part of the character, is an even number. If using
"odd" parity, this bit will be chosen so that the number of "on" bits
is an odd number. When the receiving end looks at a character which has
been transmitted with parity, if a single (or in fact 3,5,7) bits have
changed state due to line noise, the "parity" of the received character
will be wrong, and the device (or program) can act accordingly.
Unfortunately, if 2 bits (or 4,6 or 8) change state, this technique
fails to detect anything amiss. Fortunately, most line glitches only
affect a single bit.
 
Modem - MOdulator / DEModulator. Hybrid digital/analog circuit used to
transduce "voltage level" serial digital data into (from) voice-range
audio tone, which may be sent over the commercial phone network without
undue distortion or disruption of other phone company services. Ususally
uses a modulation technique called "frequency shift keying" (FSK) in
which a "carrier" frequency, in the 1 to 3 kHz range, is shifted up or
down about 500 Hz by logic 1 or 0 respectively. A Bell 103 compatible
modem uses this technique, and in fact, typically uses two carrier
frequencies which may be simultaneously modulated to support full duplex
(bidirectional communication). To be 103 compatible, particular carrier
frequencies and shifts must be employed as specified by Bell. Most 110
and/or 300 baud asynchronous modems, including the modem circuit on the
80-103A are Bell 103 compatible.
 
Originate Modem - one end of a 103 modem pair. Typically the end which is
associated with a remote terminal. Modulates (transmits on) the lower
carrier frequency, demodulates (receives on) the higher frequency.
 
Answer Modem - the other end of a 103 modem pair. Typically the end 
which is associated with a central computer. Modulates (transmits on) 
the higher carrier frequency, demodulates (receives on) the lower
carrier frequency.
 
Half Duplex - sending information over a communications line in only 
one direction at a time. Requires having a terminal which is connected
to such a line locally echo any typed characters to the terminal's
display unit. In a CLINK to CLINK connection, the answer end is forced
to half-duplex.
 
Full Duplex - sending information over a communications line in both
directions simultaneously. Allows having the "host" system echo any
characters typed on the remote terminal. This assures higher reliability
as the characters you see on the display unit of the terminal have made
it all the way through the communications line and back. The probability
of a character changing to something else (because of noise, lost bits,
etc.) being received incorrectly by the host system, and accidently
changing back to the original character on the way back is effectively
zero. This facility may also be used, by sophisticated software, to send
two different files at once, one from host to remote, the other from
remote to host, thereby saving on long distance charges. Running full
duplex also allows the host system to selectively not echo certain
characters (such as passwords) or substitute a different character(s)
for any given character received from the remote terminal. The 80-103A
will support either full or half duplex.
 
Auto-Dial - allowing a computer (or intelligent terminal) to generate
the clicks or touch tones which the switched telephone network uses to
establish links between any two phones. The 80-103A has facilities for
dialing by generating carefully timed clicks (on-hook / off-hook).
 
Auto-Answer - allowing a computer (or intelligent terminal) to answer
the phone in response to an incoming call. This is implemented by 
sensing the ring voltage (about 70 VDC) on the phone line and raising
a flag (status bit) which the computer can sense (or be interrupted by)
along with a relay which the computer can open to go "off-hook". The
80-103A has this facility.
 
Protocol - set of rules for message format and handshaking imposed on
the transmission of data to and/or from one device to another, for the
purpose of detecting and correcting errors, and allowing controlled
start/stop of the data without loss of characters. There are quite a
few protocols currently in use in the computing industry, and even a
few (mostly proposed, rather than implemented) in the hobby field.
 
Checksum - simple error detection device used by some protocols, usually
just the sum of the bytes in a message, modulo 256. Sometimes referred
to as longitudinal parity, or longitudinal reduncancy check (LRC).
Suitable for detecting all 1 bit errors, and 97% of all possible errors.
 
CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check. More elaborate error detection scheme,
which is capable of detecting 99.9987% of all possible errors. Used in
many industrial protocols, including IBM bi-sync and SDLC. Several
subtle variations are currently in use, the only difference being the
'polynomial' used in the algorithm. The most common by far is CRC-16,
followed by CRC-12. In fact, an LRC is merely a degenerate CRC, and
can be generated by the same algorithm, with a very simple polynomial.
 
Normal Use of CLINK Version 3.0 (Originate)
 
   If you have already created a configuration file (with ED or with
the "SAVE" directive in an earlier CLINK run), you can specify any or
all options at once by specifiying this file on the command line used
to start CLINK, as the first parameter. If such a file is specified,
CLINK will read the lines one by one, echo them, and process the
directives on them. If an error is detected in any line, CLINK will
notify you after that line is echoed, then abort. If created with a
text editor, this file consists of one or more lines with one directive
per line. Each directive consists of one keyword followed by a delimiter
(one or more spaces and/or tabs) followed by a legal parameter for that
keyword.
 
   Once the file (if any) has been read, you will be asked to enter any
new (or specific) directives. When all such directives have been entered,
type CR (carriage return) immediately after the prompt (empty line). At
this point, if a carrier is already present, the link is immediately
resumed.
 
   Normally, at this point, if a number was specified, it will be dialed.
If a carrier is detected within 30 seconds, the link will be initiated,
else you will be notified (NO CARRIER DETECTED), and CLINK will abort.
 
   Once the link is established, characters typed on the console are
written to the modem, and characters read from the modem are written to
the console.
 
   If an "ESCAPE" character was defined before the link was established,
then anytime that character is typed on the console, CLINK will 
temporarily escape from the link (carrier remains on) to allow you to 
enter a "local command". This can be any of the configuration directives
or one of several additional commands which are useful only once the
link has been estalished. The recommended value for ESCAPE is 1BH. This
value should be chosen so as to not conflict with any of the characters
needed by the remote system.
 
   If a "REMESC" character is defined at any given time, then at any
time after that, when that character is received from the modem
(presumably typed by the remote user), CLINK will allow the remote
user to enter a 'local' command which affects your CLINK. When
you dial into another CLINK system (which is running in ANSWER mode)
it will tell you if a REMESC character is defined, and if so, what
hex value it is.
 
   If a "BREAK" character is defined at anytime, thereafter anytime
that character is typed, the communications line will be broken for 150
milliseconds. This function is useful on certain time-sharing systems,
especially those of somewhat earlier vintage (to be polite).
 
   If an "ERROR" character is defined at any time, thereafter, that 
character will be substituted for any character read from the modem
with any type of error (parity, overrun or framing). At all times,
counts are maintained of each of these errors. These may be viewed at
any time with the 'ERROR S' command, or cleared to zero with 'RESET'.
 
Local Commands
 
   The following commands are available if the ESCAPE character has
been defined during initialization. To issue a local command, merely
type the character specified as the 'ESCAPE' code on the local console.
A prompt  ->  will be displayed, in response to which the local command
may be typed, terminated by a carriage return. Once the local command
is accepted and processed, the communications link is resumed. Note
that at no point (except with the ABORT command) is carrier dropped.
 
   If a REMESC character is defined, then anytime that character is
received from the modem a prompt will be displayed on the console of
the remote system, at which point the remote user can enter a 'local'
command which affects your copy of CLINK.
 
RETURN		Return to CP/M without dropping carrier. The link may
		be resumed after local processing by just executing
		CLINK again with the same configuration file. CLINK
		will detect the presence of the carrier and jump into
		the main loop of the link without re-dialing.
 
ABORT		Drop the carrier, hang up the phone, and exit to CP/M.
 
ERROR SUMMARY	Request a summary of the error counts (Parity, Overrun,
		and Framing) as detected since start of link (or last
		RESET command). Note that only the first character of
		SUMMARY is checked for.
 
RESET		Reset error counts to zero.
 
DEBUG ON	Enable hex debugging mode. All incoming characters are
		displayed in hexadecimal on the console, 16 per line,
		rather than in ASCII. This allows any non-printing
		characters (control codes, pad characters, etc) to be
		easily identified. Hex to ASCII tables are readily
		available, hence will not be reproduced here.
 
 
DEBUG OFF	Disable hex debugging mode, if enabled.
 
LIST		List current configuration settings to Console.
 
SAVE D:FN.FT	Write current configuration settings to specified
		CP/M file, for later use as a setup file for CLINK.
 
DIR		Same as CP/M DIR command, including ambiguous file
		names (? and * wildcards), but used from within the
		CLINK program. Prints file names 4 per line.
 
CAPTURE		Start capturing incoming characters into memory, and
		keep track of number of characters captured. Will not
		allow BDOS to be overwritten.
 
WRITE D:FN.FT	Write captured text, if any, from memory to specified
		CP/M file.
 
READ D:FN.FT	Read specified CP/M file and send it as if it were
		coming from the local console keyboard. Anytime a
		carriage return is sent, CLINK will await return of
		a line feed, and optionally ignore n additional
		'garbage' characters, then continue with the next line.
		If in FULL DUPLEX, each character is checked against
		the original as it is echoed by the remote system.
		At end of file, an error summary is printed and normal
		link operation is resumed. A READ operation may be
		aborted at any time by typing any character on the
		console of the 'sending' system.
 
GARBAGE nn	Set 'garbage' count to nn (hex). See READ command.
 
EXPAND ON	Select option whereby tabs are expanded to an
		appropriate number of spaces as they are transmitted
		via the READ command. Useful for transmission of
		files with embedded tabs to non-CP/M systems.
 
EXPAND OFF	De-select tab expansion option (default state). This
		will greatly speed up transmission of text with tabs
		to other CP/M systems, without loss of information.
 
SEND D:FN.FT	Send specified file using the MYCROFT protocol to
		another system running the RECV command in CLINK.
		May be used from either ANSWER or ORIGINATE system.
		May be used to send any type of file (including .COM
		or other 8 bit data). Will force 8 data bits, if not
		already set. Will detect virtually any possible error,
		and automatically retransmit when necessary, informing
		the user when it has done so. Will also timeout when
		an expected response is not detected in a reasonable
		length of time, and attempt to recover. May be aborted
		at any time by typing any character on the console.
		Will inform user when file has been sucessfully sent.
 
RECV D:FN.FT	Receive file being transmitted with MYCROFT protocol.
		May be used from either ORIGINATE or ANSWER system.
		Will force 8 data bits if not already set. Will inform
		user when any error is detected, and automatically
		request other end to re-transmit. Will inform user
		when entire file has been received intact.
 
BLOCK nn	Set block size to nn (hex) 256 byte pages for SEND
		command. Default is 4 pages (for 1024 byte blocks).
		Given an error free line, the larger this value is,
		the quicker the file will be sent (values over 8 are
		not recommended for general use). On a noisy line,
		the smaller this value is, the less will have to be
		re-transmitted when an error is detected.
 
Normal Use of CLINK Version 3.0 (Answer)

   If CLINK is brought up in ANSWER mode, it will not dial out even if
a number was provided, but rather will await an incoming call. Once
someone dials in, CLINK will respond with an ANSWER carrier. If, within
30 seconds, an ORIGINATE carrier is detected, a normal communications
link is established, and the ANSWER system will resond with a greeting
which includes the CLINK version number, and what the REMESC character
is, if there is any.
 
   Note that the ANSWER system must run in HALF DUPLEX, as the terminal
or ORIGINATE system will not echo characters sent by the ANSWER system.
File transmission is somewhat simpler from ORIGINATE to ANSWER, but it
will work in either direction. If a REMESC character is defined, an
unattended CLINK ANSWER system can be used as a central repository and
distribution point for text files (see DIR, READ, CAPTURE and WRITE).
 
   Note that remote 'local' commands work only from an ORIGINATE to an
ANSWER system, not vica versa. This is due to conflicts with HALF vs.
FULL DUPLEX and who echos whose characters when. Otherwise, ANSWER mode
operation is identical to ORIGINATE mode operation. It is recommended
that a single configuration file 'ANSWER' be setup on the CLINK disk
so that an ANSWER system can be quickly brought up by the command:

		CLINK ANSWER
 
Note also that no auto baud detect is available yet in ANSWER mode.
 
File Transmission Using MYCROFT Protocol
 
   To transmit a file from one CLINK system to another, one may simply
establish a normal link (as described above), then have the receiving
system enter the local command 'RECV D:FN.FT' (where D:FN.FT is the
CP/M file name of the file to be written), and the transmitting system
enter the local command 'SEND D:FN.FT' (where D:FN.FT is the name of an
existing file on the transmitting system's disk). From that point until
CLINK informs both users that the transmission is complete, no further
interaction is required on the part of the user, unless the sender
decides to abort the transmission before the entire file is transmitted.
Informative messages may be printed as possible errors are detected and
corrective action is taken by both systems, but no response is required
from either user. If a large number of retransmissions are required, it
is suggested that the block size be reduced with the BLOCK command.
 
Description of MYCROFT Protocol
 
   CLINK uses a simple asynchronous protocol to transmit files with 
reliable error detection and automatic retransmission of bad data. It
is very loosely based on DEC's DDCMP. There are four possible messages
which may be used at various times during a file transmission:
 
	Data Message - contains typically 1024 bytes of data
	Acknowlege - used to acknowlege reception of an intact message
	Negative Acknowledge - used to request re-transmission
	End of Transmission - used to indicate end-of-file
 
All messages start with an SOH (ASCII Start Of Header). The second byte
is a message type code (NUL, ACK, NAK or EOT). On all messages but the
data message, a two byte CRC then follows, high order byte first. On
data messages, after the NUL code, a two byte message length (in bytes,
high order byte first) follows, then an STX (ASCII Start of Text), then
the actual data bytes, then an ETX (ASCII End of Text), then the two
byte CRC, as before. In summary, the messages are as follows:
 
	SOH NUL hicnt locnt STX data data ... data ETX CRC CRC
 
	SOH ACK CRC CRC
 
	SOH NAK CRC CRC
 
	SOH EOT CRC CRC
 
Note that the range of the CRC (that is, the data which is used in
building it) encompasses all bytes in a message except the SOH and the
CRC bytes themselves.
 
Sample File Transmission (on a VERY noisy line)
 
	Msg 1	--->	ok		normal reception
	ok	<---	ACK		normal acknowledge
 
	Msg 2	--->	error		error detected
	ok	<---	NAK		retransmit request
	Msg 2	--->	ok		retransmission
	error	<---	ACK		ACK received in error
	NAK	--->	ok		retransmit request
	ok	<---	ACK		previous msg re-sent
 
	Msg 3	--->			message lost
 
	Msg 3	--->	ok		resent after 10 sec timeout
	ok	<---	ACK		normal acknowledge
 
	Msg 4	--->	error		error detected
		<---	NAK		response lost
 
	ok	<---	NAK		resent after 10 sec. timeout
	Msg 4	--->	ok		normal re-transmit
	ok	<---	ACK		normal acknowledge
 
	EOT	--->	ok		That's all folks
	ok	<---	EOT		EOT acknowledge
