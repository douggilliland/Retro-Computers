		-LT31LBR.DOC:  A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF LT31.LBR

   LT31.COM is a very versatile compressed file utility that can:

1.  TYPE (with, or without the "MORE" feature) uncompressed files, files
    compressed by Squeezing, LZW Crunched files, and LZH version 1.x and 2.0
    compressed files.  All ASCII (text) files can be typed, whether stand
    alone or members of a Library (.LBR).

2.  Decompresses ALL types of files, compressed by any of the above noted
    methods, from the designated drive and user to the designated drive and
    user.

3.  Extracts from libraries (.LBR) and decompresses ALL types of files,
    compressed by any of the above noted methods, from the designated drive,
    user, and library to the designated drive and user.

   LT31.LBR is an improved version of LT30.LBR.  The major new features of
LT31.LBR are as follows:

1.  Version 31 corrects a bug in version 30 (and probably all versions back to
    25) that prevented LT from accepting USER specifications as a SOURCE of
    data.  (Many thanks to Roger Warren, Sysop, Elephant's Graveyard San
    Diego, California for the suggestions for fixing this problem.)

2.  Version 31 also changed the 6 labels in the MAC file, which had 7
    characters, to 6 character labels.	That was done to make LT31.MAC
    compatible with an ancient (about 1979) version of M80 that will not
    accept labels with more than 6 characters.	This change does not in any
    way impair the use of LT31.MAC with any other assembler.

3.  LT31.LBR also features a revised, integrated, and improved User Manual
    (LT31.DOC) for easier comprehension.  It integrates several separate
    documents from LT30.LBR, most of which have now been eliminated as
    separate entities in the distributed library.

   The following describes features of LT30.LBR AND LT29.LBR which are
retained in LT31.LBR.

LT30 - Incorporated version 2.0 of LZH encoding.  This program is necessary to
decode files encoded with version 2.0 of LZH compression, but will
AUTOMATICALLY handle files encoded with version 1.x LZH encoding. Added
appropriate documentation changes. Added instruction to reset MSB in output
FCBs. Corrected error message pointer for UNC & UNL errors (sent garbage to
screen).  Version 2.0 of LZH compression compresses more compactly than
versions 1.x.  It also compresses faster than versions 1.x.  - R. Warren

LT29 - Added the capability to handle LZH-encoded files (files with extensions
of the form ?Y?).  No other functional changes. - R. Warren

		      PRINTING THE USER MANUAL, LT31.DOC

   The LT31.DOC User Manual is actually an *.PRN file with its file extension
name changed to MAN.  It was produced by Peachtext word processing software.
It is formatted for printing with any standard dumb printer at:
    Form Length 11"
    66 Lines at 6 lines per inch
    Top Margin 4 lines
    Bottom Margin 4 lines
    Paper Width 8 1/2"
    Pitch 12 Characters per inch
    Left Margin 0 Characters
    Right Margin 79 characters

   To print LT31.DOC, use standard 8 1/2" x 11" fanfold paper on your tractor
feed.  Then set your printer (or your printing or word processing software) to
the following values:
    Horizontal Spacing 12 characters per inch
    Left Margin 12 characters
    Right Margin 79 characters or more
    Form Length 11"
    Top Margin 0 lines
    Bottom Margin 0 lines

   If the word processing software you are using to print LT31.MAN uses
special printable characters as recognition characters for special functions,
such as Bold Face, Half Lines, Underlining, Command Sign, etc., you should set
them all to a nil value.  This is necessary because LT31.DOC contains some of
the characters sometimes used for recognition character purposes, in
particular <, >, and &.
