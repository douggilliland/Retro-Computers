        This program is a super-duper CP/M disk directory maintence utility
that is designed as an "almost" all inclusive routine to make it easy to do
disk directory house keeping. The inspiration to produce this program came
from use of an older utility program called "CLEAN" that I came across at a
meeting of the Valley Computer Club about a year and a half ago. At that time
"CLEAN" seemed like a dream come true. Unfortunately it had several major
problems that limited its overall usefullness. The disadvantages of CLEAN have
all been overcome with the new WASH program. Program features are listed
below:

        a) Alphabetical list oriented file operations

        b) Any legal CP/M drive (A: to P:) may be selected

        c) Operator interface to the file list is at the console
           in sequential apha order in forward or backup mode.

        d) The file list is treated as a circular buffer. Forward
           or backward scanning of the list wraps around the list
           back to the beginning or ending respectively.

        e) The current list position file can be viewed at the
           Console, printed on the CP/M List device, or sent
           to the CP/M Punch device.

        f) The current list position file may be deleted or renamed.
           If renamed, only the new name must be entered.

        g) The current list position file may be copied, with the
           same name, to any other operator selected disk drive.
           The copy utilizes all of available memory as the copy
           buffer for the ultimate in copy speed.

        h) The current list can be deleted and the "WASH" operation
           may be begun upon another operator selected disk drive.

        i) The program is fully implemented in 8080 assembly language
           for speed, small size, and portability to any CP/M 2.2
           or 1.4 system. No assumption is made upon the maximum
           number of directory files other than available memory
           space for the list. (A directory with 1024 directory
           file names takes 12 K bytes of storage. Assuming the
           copy buffer minimum size requirement of 128 bytes, then
           WASH should easily run in the minimum CP/M 2.2 20K
           System with no problems at all.) ALL directory and
           disk I/O is handled through calls to the BDOS. This
           will guarentee WASH compatibility with any CP/M system
           implementation. This makes the program disk media
           independent (all you have to do is get WASH.COM onto
           your diskette or hard disk in the first place.

Running WASH
------------

        The WASH program is run as a transient command under CP/M 2.2
or CP/M 1.4 as follows. The program creates a working list of all selected
file names on the selected drive. Examples of command formats are:

        A>WASH<cr>              <== WASH forms working list
                                    of all files from default drive A:.

        A>WASH B:<cr>           <== WASH forms working list of all
                                    files from selected drive B:.

        A>WASH *.COM<cr>        <== WASH formas working list of all
                                    ".COM" files from default drive A:.

        WASH will boot up and read all selected file names from the selected
drive into a "MEMORY" list that is in ascending alphabetical order. The first
file name will be displayed with a ":" prompt awaiting some command from the
operator. The following summary describes WASH commands.

WASH Commands
-------------

        The Wash program permits entry of various commands while the console
cursor is positioned at a ":" prompt after the currently displayed file name
in the file name list.

**** File List Manipulation Comands.

        File Forward (SPACE or CARRIAGE RETURN) Command
        -----------------------------------------------

        This command will increment the displayed list pointer and
        then display the  next file name in the list. If last file
        name in list is currently displayed, the message "End of List"
        is displayed and file name display wraps around to the first
        file name.

        Backup (B) Command
        ------------------

        This command will decrement the displayed list pointer and
        display the previous file name from the list. If the first file
        name in the list is currently displayed, the message "Beginning
        of List" is displayed and the file name display wraps back to
        the last file name in the list.


**** File Operation Commands.

        View (V) File Command
        ---------------------

        The contents of the currently displayed file name is output
        to the console screen. Text is normally assumed to be ASCII
        and file display ceases upon encountering a logical end of
        file character (01AH) (ctl-z).

        Punch (P) File Command
        ----------------------

        The contents of the currently displayed file name output
        to the CP/M logical Punch device. Text is normally assumed to
        be ASCII and file punching ceases upon encountering a logical end
        of file character (01AH) (ctl-z).

        List (L) File Command
        ---------------------

        The contents of the currently displayed file name is output
        to the CP/M logical List device. Text is normally assumed to
        be ASCII and file listing ceases upon encountering a logical
        end of file character (01AH) (ctl-z).

        Copy (C) File Command
        ---------------------

        This command allows the complete contents of the currently
        displayed file name to copied to a file on another operator
        selected drive with the same name. If the file name already
        exists on the destiantion disk, the operator is asked if it
        should be replaced.

        Delete (D) File Command
        -----------------------

        The file with name corresponding to the currently displayed
        list name is deleted from the disk directory. After deletion
        the message "Deleted" is displayed at the console. Deleted
        file name is also removed from the in memory list.

        Rename (R) File Command
        -----------------------

        The file name currently displayed is renamed to the operator
        entered name in response to the "New Name ?" prompt. The list
        in memory is also updated to reflect the new file name.

**** Miscellaneous Commands.

        Exit (X) Command
        ----------------

        Command when entered will terminate WASH operation and return
        system control to the CP/M Console Command Processor via a
        warm boot operation.

        Start (S) over on New Drive Command
        -----------------------------------

        Entry of the Start over command will cause the WASH program
        to make up a new directory name list in memory from the drive
        designator entered by the operator in response to the "New
        Drive ?" prompt.


OPERATIONAL NOTES ON WASH
-------------------------

        Command entries not understood by WASH will cause display of a
"?" character followed by redisplay of the same current list position
file name. Command entries, other than Backup, will generally execute
and then return to the command mode with the next file name from the list
displayed.

        Entry of a carriage return in response to the "New Name ?" prompt
of the Rename command or to the "New Drive ?" prompt of the Start Over
command will abort the command function and cause display of the next file
name in the file name list.

        The WASH program contains a liberal number of error checking
functions not normally seen by the operator unless an error condition
arises. These are always displayed with leading and trailing pairs of the
plus sign character as:

        ++ Error Message ++

Some of the error conditions are:

        ++ Not Found ++

                command line wild card file specification
                name list is empty, or disk is empty.

                -or-

                delete, rename, copy source files not found.
                (most likely due to a diskette change)

        ++ Name Already Exists ++

                attempt to rename a file to a name already present
                on the disk.

        ++ File Cannot Be Opened ++

                output file for view, list, or punch, cannot be
                opened for reading. Most probable cause is due to
                a disk change.

        ++ Source File Cannot Be Opened ++

                source file on a copy operation cannot be found on
                the disk. Most likely casued by a disk change.

        ++ Cannot Select Same Disk as Source ++

                the copy to destination disk selected by the operator
                must be different than the source disk.

        ++ Destination Directory Full ++

                The destination file on a copy operation cannot be opened
                because the destination disk directory is full.

        ++ No Memory Available For Copy Buffer ++

                Caused when size of in memory list is so large that an
                attempted copy operation can find no buffer space.

        ++ Disk or Directory Full on Write ++

                Caused when a copy operation attempts to place a file
                on a destination disk that does not have enough room
                for the file, or not enough room to contain all the
                directory extent entries for the destination file.

        ++ Destination Close Error ++

                Destination file on a copy operation cannot be closed
                most likely due to a full directory.

Looking at WASH in Action
-------------------------

        The following text is an example session with WASH at the console.
This dislay was made possible through use of Kelly Smith's new console
i/o capture program I/O-CAP.COM. The intepretation of the action below
should be self evident via the descriptions in the above sections.
The text "<== xxxxxxxxxxxx" indicates text typed in for documentation
purposes and not by the WASH program.
