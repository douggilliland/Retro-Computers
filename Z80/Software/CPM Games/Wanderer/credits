                            WANDERER CREDITS
                           ==================

This file should always be available to all players of the game. Feel free to
add anything necessary, eg, if you create some new screens, but don't *delete*
anything! The people in here have worked hard and deserve all the fame they
can get :-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Wanderer was created by Steven Shipway, a first year mathematics
student at Warwick University, England.  The idea came from games such as
Boulderdash, Xor, and especially the Repton games from Superior Software.

        Later improvements came from play@nl.cwi, who designed the editor
and made countless bugfixes, of which there are too many to list here. He
also improved many parts of the original code, and also designed some
screens. Also Dave (david@ist.co.uk), who did most of the work towards the
improved level jumping routine (sorry, I had to alter it a bit due to other
changes). Jason (jason@uucp.aeras) is responsible for the help routine, for
which I am eternally grateful since it saved me a lot of work.
        I should really mention Harvey Thompson (hjt@uk.ac.warwick.cs) as
well, since he provided the idea behind the encryption system ( the seeded
random exclusive or ). However I won't, since it will annoy him terribly!
        Thanx to meulenbr@nl.philips.prl.cst (Frans) for the idea behind the
addition of the balloons.

                me or post to the net for correction to this list.

 All of these screens are possible with the current version of Wanderer (2.2).

        Any new screens you wish to have added to the list please mail to
me for release in a official update package. The address is currently
maujp@uk.ac.warwick.cu or maujp%uk.ac.warwick.cu@nsfnet-relay.ac.uk .
Please note that the bitnet address has changed recently, and several items of
email have gone astray.

 The X-Windows port - which is pretty impressive - comes from Mike Cuddy.
His address is cuddy%convex@edu.umich.cc.umix or convex!cuddy. Although
I haven't been able to see this one for myself a friend assures me that the
graphics are fantastic.

 The official PC Port for Wanderer was done by Greg Margo, who may be found
at gmago@uucp.netxcom or ...!uunet!netxcom!gmargo.
 The Acorn Archimedes port was done by Max Rockatansky, jn@uk.ac.ukc . Mail
him if you want a copy. ( Although he could well charge for the disc... )
 The port to the Amiga was courtesy of Alan Bland ( mab@druwy.uucp ) who has
included sound and graphics to the game. As before, he's the one to mail if
you want to know more.

        Also thanks to Paul Metcalf for thinking of a name for the game!
