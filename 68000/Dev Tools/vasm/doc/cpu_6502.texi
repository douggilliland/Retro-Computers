This chapter documents the backend for the MOS/Rockwell 6502
microprocessor family. It also supports the Rockwell/WDC 65C02 and the
Hudson Soft HuC6280 instruction sets.

@section Additional options for this module

This module provides the following additional options:

@table @option
    @item -6280
        Recognize all HuC6280 instructions.
    @item -bbcade
        Swap meaning of @code{<} and @code{>} unary operators for compatibility
        with the BBC ADE assembler.
    @item -c02
        Recognize all 65C02 instructions. This excludes DTV (@option{-dtv})
        and illegal (@option{-illegal}) instructions.
    @item -dtv
        Recognize the three additional C64-DTV instructions.
    @item -illegal
        Allow 'illegal' 6502 instructions to be recognized.
    @item -opt-branch
        Enables 'optimization' of B<cc> branches into
        "B<!cc> *+5 ; JMP label" sequences when necessary.
    @item -wdc02
        Recognize all 65C02 instructions and the WDC65C02 extensions
        (RMB,SMB,BBR,BBS,STP,WAI).

@section General

This backend accepts 6502 family instructions as described in
the instruction set reference manuals from MOS and Rockwell, which are valid
for the following CPUs: 6502 - 6518, 6570, 6571, 6702, 7501, 8500, 8502.

Optionally accepts 65C02 family instructions as decribed in the
instruction set reference manuals from Rockwell and WDC. Also supports
the WDC extensions in the W65C02 and W65C134.

Optionally accepts 65CE02 family instructions as decribed in the
instruction set reference manuals from Commodore Semiconductor Group.

Optionally accepts HuC6280 instructions as described in the instruction
set reference manuals from Hudson Soft.

The target address type is 16 bit.

Instructions consist of one up to three bytes for the standard 6502 family
(up to 7 bytes for the 6280) and require no alignment.
There is also no alignment requirement for sections and data.

All known mnemonics for illegal instructions are optionally recognized (e.g.
@code{dcm} and @code{dcp} refer to the same instruction). Some illegal
insructions (e.g. @code{$ab}) are known to show unpredictable behaviour,
or do not always work the same on different CPUs.

@section Extensions

This backend provides the following specific extensions:

@itemize @minus

@item The parser understands a lo/hi-modifier to select low- or high-byte
 of a 16-bit word. The character @code{<} is used to select the low-byte
 and @code{>} for the high-byte. It has to be the first character before
 an expression.

@item When applying the operation @code{/256}, @code{%256} or @code{&256}
 on a label, an appropriate lo/hi-byte relocation will automatically be
 generated.

@end itemize

This backend extends the selected syntax module by the following
directives:

@table @code
@item <symbol> ezp <expr>
      Works exactly like the @code{equ} directive, but marks <symbol>
      as a zero page symbol and use zero page addressing whenever
      <symbol> is used in a memory addressing mode.

@item setdp <expr>
      Set the current base address of the zero/direct page for
      optimizations from absolute to zero-page addressing modes.
      Example: set it to @code{$2000} for the HuC6280/PC-Engine.

@item zpage <symbol>
      Mark <symbol> as zero page and use zero page addressing for
      expressions based on this symbol.
@end table

@section Optimizations

This backend performs the following operand optimizations:

@itemize @minus

@item Branches, where the destination is out of range, are translated
 into @code{B<!cc> *+5} and an absolute @code{JMP} instruction.

@item None.
