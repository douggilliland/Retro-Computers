                             I. Introduction 


        This manual describes the Motorola 68000 microprocessor 
simulator program.  The program loads 68000 object files in S-record
format, and simulates the 68000's execution of the code.  The full set 
of 68000 operations is implemented.

        The simulator was written in VAX-11 C and Microsoft C 5.0 and 
should be portable with little modification to any C language 
implementation.  Versions of the simulator are presently available for 
the VAX and IBM PC computers.

                                                                           3
                     II.  The Simulator Environment 


     When you start the simulator, you will see the main screen, which
looks like this:


<D0>  = 00000000  <D4>  = 00000000  <A0>  = 00000000  <A4> = 00000000
<D1>  = 00000000  <D5>  = 00000000  <A1>  = 00000000  <A5> = 00000000
<D2>  = 00000000  <D6>  = 00000000  <A2>  = 00000000  <A6> = 00000000
<D3>  = 00000000  <D7>  = 00000000  <A3>  = 00000000  <A7> = 00000000
trace: off        sstep: off        cycles:      0    <A7'>= 00000f00
         cn  tr  st  rc           T S  INT   XNZVC    <PC> = 00000000
  port1  00  00  82  00      SR = 0010000000000000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 



II.1    Data Registers and Address Registers: 

     At the top you can see the eight general-purpose data registers and
the eight address registers as well as the system stack pointer (A7').
Recall that the user stack pointer is called A7 while the system stack
pointer is referred to as A7'.  In the simulator's user interface, the
user stack pointer will be called A7 and the system stack pointer will
be referred to as A8.  So, if you want to change the value in the system
stack pointer, you must use the command "ch a8".



II.2    Program Counter, Status Register, and Cycle Counter: 

     Under the system stack pointer is the program counter.  To the left
of the program counter is the status register, which is displayed in 
binary form so that the individual bits can be examined at a glimpse.
Above the status register is the cycle counter which contains the number
of machine cycles that elapse while the microprocessor runs your program.


II.3    Trace and Single Step: 

     The Trace and Single Stepping indicators show the status of trace
and single stepping modes.  If single stepping mode is turned on, the 
program will run only one 68000 instruction after you type "go" at the
">" prompt.  If the trace mode is turned on, the program will update the
screen after the execution of every instruction while a program is being
run.  Trace mode should not be confused with the 68000 trace mode which
is turned on by turning on the "t" bit in the status register.


II.4    The Port Display: 

     The display for "port1" is to show the status of a simulated 6850
asynchronous communications interface adapter (ACIA) chip.  This 
simulated chip is not implemented at this time.

                                                                           4
II.5    The Memory Space: 

     The simulator has a "virtual" memory space from location 0 to
location FFF (Hex).  Programs may be loaded into any part of this 
virtual memory space.  However, you must pay attention to the fact that
the locations under 0C0 (Hex) are used as exception vectors.  More
detailed information on exception processing is contained in Section V
(Exception Processing).


II.6    Startup Condition: 

     On startup, the status register is clear except for the supervisor
bit which is on.  The system stack pointer is set to locatin F00 (Hex).
Note that the system stack grows downward, so that if any exception
condition occurs, the processor will have room to grow downward.  Be
careful about setting the system stack pointer to very low values or to
a value of zero since that would create an out-of-memory-space error
if the stack was used, which would cause an irrecoverable condition.

                                                                           5
                      III.  Using The Simulator: 

III.1    Loading a Program: 

     A program may be loaded by typing "ld <program name>" at the ">"
prompt.  <program name> may contain a path if the file to be loaded
is not in the current directory.  

     NOTE: The ".h68" extension is required in the <program name> if the
object module to be loaded does indeed have the extension ".h68".


III.2    Displaying and Changing Registers and Memory: 

     Registers are displayed on the main screen.  If the display gets 
garbled up for any reason, you may instruct the program to re-draw it
by using the "refresh" command.

     To change register values, use the command "ch <Rx> <val>", where
<Rx> is a value such as D0 to D7, or A0 to A8, and <val> is a hexadecimal
number not greater than FFFFFFFF.  Similarly, the program counter may
be altered by "ch pc <val>".

     To change bits in the status register, type <bit>_on or <bit>_off,
where <bit> is one of these letters:  "t", "s", "v", "x", "z", "c" or "n".
To change the value of the interrupt bits, type "ch int <val>", where
<val> is a number from 0 to 7.

     To display values in memory, type "md <start loc> <stop loc>", where
<start loc> is the hexadecimal first location to be displayed and <stop loc> 
is the last location to be displayed.

     To change values in memory, type "ch mem <loc>" where <loc> is the 
memory location you wish to alter the contents of.  Then, type in the 
new value of that location at the prompt.  You may enter byte, word, or
longword-sized values to be stored in memory.


III.3   Setting Simulator Options: 

     If you wish to have the program update the values of registers on the
screen after the execution of every instruction in your program, use the
command "trace".  To turn this feature off, use "troff".

     If you wish the program to execute one instruction at a time, use the
command "sstep".  To turn this feature off, use "ssoff".

     WARNING:  If you run your program without using the single step command,
and you do not set any break points, then the program may run in an infinite
loop, run beyond your program, or have other unpredictable results.
Concievable situations are for the program to run into data that it 
interprets as illegal instructions or run until it goes beyond the virtual
memory space.  Both of these situations will cause exception conditions
(see Section V).


III.4   Using Breakpoints: 

     Use the "bp" command to set, clear, and display break points.  Before
running your program, you should set at least one breakpoint at the point 
you wish your program to "return" if you have not set the single stepping 
mode.  This will keep your program from running out of control.

                                                                           6
                          IV.  Simulator Commands: 


IV.1  The Load Command:    (load 68000 program)

     Loads   ASCII  hex  file  (".h68"  file  produced  by  the  68000 
     assembler) into memory.

     EXAMPLE :  "ld file1.h68"


IV.2  The Change Command:    (change registers or memory)

     Ch  allows  you  to  change the values  of  the  simulated  68000 
     registers or main memory.

     D<num> <val>     places <val> in register D<num>.   <num> is in the 
                      range 0 - 7.

     A<num> <val>     places <val> in A register # num.  <num> is in the 
                      range 0 - 8.

       NOTE: the supervisor stack pointer (A7') is referenced as "A8".

     PC <val>         places <val> in the program counter.

     int <val>        places  <val> in the interrupt mask bits of  the 
                      status register.  <val> is in the range 0 - 7.

     mem <loc> <val>  places <val> in location <loc>.

     io               allows you to modify the port registers.
     

IV.3  The Clear Command:   (clear registers, memory, or cycles)

     CLEAR allows you to clear different elements within the processor
     and the simulator.
     
     mem         fills the memory space with zero's.
     reg         fills all the registers with zero's.
     port        clears port.
     int         clears any pending interrupts.
     cy          clears the cycle counter.
     all         clears all of the above items.


IV.4  The Bit_on and Bit_off Commands:   (change status register bits)

     bit_on allows you to turn on a specific bit in the statu
     regist
     
     s_on         turns on the supervisor bit
     t_on         turns on the trace bit
     x_on         turns on the extend bit
     n_on         turns on the negative bit
     z_on         turns on the zero bit
     v_on         turns on the overflow bit
     c_on         turns on the carry bit

                                                                           7
     bit_off allows you to turn off a specific bit in the status register
          
     s_off         turns off the supervisor bit
     t_off         turns off the trace bit
     x_off         turns off the extend bit
     n_off         turns off the negative bit
     z_off         turns off the zero bit
     v_off         turns off the overflow bit
     c_off         turns off the carry bit


IV.5  The Memory Display Command:     (display main memory)

     Memory Display allows you to view the contents of a set of
     memory location:

     md <start> <stop> displays   locations  between  start  and  stop 
                       inclusive.  If  only a start value is  specifed 
                       then only that location will be displayed.


IV.6  The Break Point Command:   (break point setting)

     Break Points allows you to set clear and show break points.
     
     bp sp <loc>         sets a break point at loc.
     bp cp <loc>         clears the break point at loc.
     bp dp               displays a list of the break points.


IV.7  The dec and hex Commands:   (number conversion commands)

     Dec allows you to convert a hexadecimal number into decimal format.
     
     dec <number>   shows the number in decimal format.  <number> must 
                    be input in hexadecimal format.
     

     Hex allows you to convert a decimal number into hexadecimal format.
     
     hex <number>   shows the number in hexadecimal format.   <number> 
                    must be input in decimal format.
     
                                                                           8
IV.8  The Sstep and Ssoff Commands:   (control the single step option)

     sstep      turns  on single stepping mode.   This makes the  'go' 
                command run only one instruction at a time.

     ssoff      turns off single stepping mode.   This makes the  'go' 
                command run instructions until

                    1. the processor encounters a breakpoint, or
                    2. an exception condition occurs.


IV.9  The Trace and Troff Commands:   (control the trace option)

     trace      turn on trace mode.   This activates trace mode  while 
                running a program.

     troff      turns  off  trace mode.   This deactivates trace  mode 
                while running a program.


IV.10   The Refresh Command:   (rewrite screen)

     REFRESH updates the register set and other on-screen  information 
     (such as port registers, SR, and cycles.)


IV.11   The Go Command:   (execute a program)

     GO starts executing a hector program at the location specified.

     EXAMPLE :  "go 4B0"   start executing at 4B0 (HEX).


IV.12   The Help Command:   (online help)

     The  HELP  command allows the user to enter a help mode and  view 
     information about simulator commands.



IV.13   The Exit Command:   (exit simulator)

     EXIT exits the simulator and returns you to the command language.

                                                                           9
                      V.  Exception Processing: 


V.1   Disabling and Enabling Exception Processing: 

     If  you are not concerned with modeling the exact behavior of the 
     68000  chip,  you may wish to disable exception processing  using 
     the "ex_off" command.   In this mode, when an exception condition 
     is encountered the simulator stops running the 68000 program  and 
     prints a message telling what sort of exception occurred.

     To re-enable exception processing, use the "ex_on" command.

     The   simulator's  default  mode  is  "ex_off",   with  exception 
     processing disabled.


V.2   Description of Exception Conditions: 

     Exception   processing  can  begin  in  several  different  ways. 
Generally, there are three classes of exception conditions:

        Group 0: Reset, Address error, Bus error.
        Group 1: Trace, Interrupt, Illegal, Privilege violation.
        Group 2: TRAP, TRAPV, CHK, and Divide by zero.

     The following is some information on each of these exceptions  as 
they relate to the simulator:

  -- Reset cannot occur in this simulator.

  -- Address error occurs when an word or long word is written or read 
          from an odd word boundary.  i.e. an odd memory address.

  -- Bus error  can  occur in this simulator by attempting to read  or 
          write  outside  of the virtual memory  space.   The  virtual 
          memory  for  this simulator is from location 0  to  location 
          0FFF (hex).

  -- Trace is  entered  if on the completion of  an  instruction,  the 
          trace bit of the status register is on.

  -- Interrupt   occurs  when  an  external  device   interrupts   the 
          processor's operation.  Presently, this cannot occur on this 
          simulator.

  -- Illegal  exception  occurs when an illegal instruction opcode  is 
          executed.   It  also occurs when the ILLEGAL instruction  is 
          executed.

  -- Privilege  violation  occurs  when a  privileged  instruction  is 
          attempted  and the supervisor bit in the status register  is 
          not set.

                                                                          10
  -- TRAP exception occurs when a TRAP instruction is executed.

  -- TRAPV exception occurs when a TRAPV instruction is executed.

  -- CHK exception occurs when a CHK instruction is executed.

  -- Divide  by zero exception occurs when a DIVU or DIVS  instruction 
          attempts a division by zero.


V.3   What Happens During Exception Processing: 

     Exception processing begins by creating the appropriate exception 
stack  frame  for  the particular exception group  on  the  supervisor 
stack.   Then,  the  supervisor  mode is turned on and trace  mode  is 
turned off.  After that, instruction execution resumes at the location 
referenced by the appropriate exception vector.   The exception vector 
locations that can be used in this simulator are listed below:


       Location (Hex)        Assignment

           008               Bus error
           00C               Address error
           010               Illegal instruction
           014               Divide by zero
           018               CHK instruction
           01C               TRAPV instruction
           020               Privilege violation
           024               Trace
           028               Line 1010 emulator
           02C               Line 1111 emulator
        080 to 0BC           TRAP instruction vectors


     When the simulator starts up the supervisor bit is set on and the 
supervisor stack pointer is set to the value F00 (hex).  Note that the 
stack grows downward,  so the stack frame for any exceptions will grow 
from F00 downward.

     For  complete information on exception processing,  refer to  the 
68000 Programmer's Reference Manual, Section 4.
