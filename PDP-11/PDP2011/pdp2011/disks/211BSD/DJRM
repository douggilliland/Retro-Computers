# The define Q22 has been removed.  The references to it were incorrect

# Rootdev, swapdev etc. should be in terms of makedev.  For example,
# if you have an SMD drive using the xp driver, rootdev would be xp0a,
# or "makedev(10,0)".  Swapdev would be the b partition, xp0b, or
# "makedev(10,1)".  The 10 is the major number of the device (the offset
# in the bdevsw table in conf.c) and the 0 and 1 are the minor numbers
# which correspond to the partitions as described in the section 4 manual
# pages.  You can also get the major numbers from the MAKEDEV script in
# /dev.

# NBUF is the size of the buffer cache, and is directly related to the UNIBUS
# mapping registers.  There are 32 total mapping registers, of which 30 are
# available.  The 0'th is used for CLISTS, and the 31st is used for the I/O
# page on some PDP's.  It's suggested that you allow 7 mapping registers
# per UNIBUS character device so that you can move 56K of data on each device
# simultaneously.  The rest should be assigned to the block buffer pool.  So,
# if you have a DR-11 and a TM-11, you would leave 14 unassigned for them and
# allocate 16 to the buffer pool.  Since each mapping register addresses 8
# buffers for a 1K file system, NBUF would be 128.  A possible exception would
# be to reduce the buffers to save on data space, as they were 24 bytes each
# Should be 'small' for GENERIC, so room for kernel + large program to run.

# DIAGNOSTIC does various run-time checks, some of which are pretty
# expensive and at a high priority.  Suggested use is when the kernel
# is crashing and you don't know why, otherwise run with it off.
