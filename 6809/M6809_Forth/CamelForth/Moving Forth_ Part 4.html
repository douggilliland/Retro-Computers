<h2 align="CENTER">Part 4: Assemble or Metacompile?</h2>

<h3 align="CENTER">by Brad Rodriguez</h3>

<p><font size="-1">This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.psyber.com/~tcj">The
Computer Journal</a> #64 (November/December 1993).</font></p>

<p>"Keep it SHORT!" was the editorial directive for this installment.
So I apologize for postponing the source listings to yet another issue.
In the meantime, there is a new decision to contemplate: </p>

<h2><b>How do you build a Forth system for the Very First Time? </b></h2>

<p>You know now that most Forth code is high-level "threads,"
usually compiled as just a series of addresses. In the early days of fig-Forth,
assemblers were often the only programming tools available. This was fine
for writing Forth CODE words, but high- level threads had to be written
as a series of DW directives. For example, the Forth word </p>

<pre> 
: MAX ( n n - n)   OVER OVER &lt; IF SWAP THEN DROP ;
</pre>

<p>would be written [TAL80] </p>

<pre>      DW OVER,OVER,LESS,ZBRAN
      DW MAX2-$
      DW SWAP
MAX2: DW DROP,SEMIS
</pre>

<p>Later, as working Forth systems became widespread, Forthwrights began
modifying the Forth compilers into cross-compilers [CAS80]. Thus with Forth
on your CP/M machine (or Apple II, or whatever), you could write Forth
programs for some other CPU...up to and including an entirely new Forth
system for that CPU. </p>

<p>Because they create a new Forth from within Forth, these are often called
metacompilers. Computer science purists object to this, so some Forthies
use the terms "cross-compiler" and "recompiler." The
difference is that a recompiler can only generate a new Forth for the <u>same</u>
CPU. </p>

<p>Most PC Forths are now produced with metacompilers, but opinion is divided
in the embedded systems arena [TIN91,ROD91,SER91]. The arguments for using
assemblers to write Forth are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Metacompilers are cryptic and hard to understand, and you must thoroughly
understand a metacompiler in order to use it. </li>

<li>Assemblers are understood by the average programmer. </li>

<li>An assembler is almost always available for a new CPU. </li>

<li>Assemblers handle many optimizations (e.g. short vs. long branch).
</li>

<li>Assemblers handle forward references and peculiar address modes; many
metacompilers don't. </li>

<li>Assemblers use familiar editing and debugging tools. </li>

<li>The code generation is completely visible -- nothing is "hidden"
from the programmer. </li>

<li>It's easier to tweak the Forth model, since many design decisions affect
the internals of a metacompiler. </li>
</ol>

<p>The arguments for metacompilers: </p>

<ol>
<li>You write "normal" looking Forth code, which is easier to
read and debug. </li>

<li>Once you understand your metacompiler, you can port it easily to new
CPUs. </li>

<li>The only tool you need to acquire is a Forth for your computer. </li>
</ol>

<p>The last is particularly applicable to those who don't own PCs, since
most cross-assemblers require PCs or workstations these days. </p>

<p>I've written several Forths each way, so I'm painfully aware of the
tradeoffs. I admit a preference for metacompilers: I find the Forth code
for MAX much easier to read and understand than its assembler equivalent.
Most of the arguments against metacompilers have been overcome by modern
"professional" compilers, and if you're using Forth for work
I <u>strongly</u> recommend investing in a commercial product. Alas, public-domain
metacompilers (including my own) are still behind the times, clunky, and
arcane. </p>

<p>So I'm going to take a radical position for a Forth programmer, and
tell you to <u>choose for yourself</u>. I'll publish the 6809 code in metacompiler
form, and I'll supply a metacompiler for F83 (IBM PC, CP/M, or Atari ST)
[ROD92]. The Z80 code will be written for a CP/M assembler. The 8051 code
will be written for a public- domain PC cross-assembler. </p>

<p><b>Forth in C?</b> </p>

<p>No discussion of this topic would be complete without mentioning a new
trend: Forths written in C. These have the advantage of being more portable
than assembler -- in theory, all you have to do is recompile the same source
code for any CPU. The disadvantages: </p>

<ol>
<li>Less flexibility in the design decisions; e.g., direct-threaded code
is probably not possible, and you can't optimize register assignments.
</li>

<li>You have to recompile the C source to add new primitives. </li>

<li>Forth words carry the C call-and-return overhead. </li>

<li>Some C Forths use inefficient threading techniques, e.g. a CASE statement.
</li>

<li>Most C compilers produce less efficient code than a good assembly-language
programmer. </li>
</ol>

<p>But for Unix systems and RISC workstations, which frown upon assembler,
this may be the only way to get a Forth up and running. The most complete
and widely used of the public-domain C Forths <i>[at the time of publication]</i>
is TILE (TILE_21.ZIP, file #2263 on GEnie's Forth Roundtable). If you're
not running Unix, you should look instead at the Genie files HENCE4TH_1.2.A
(#2490) and CFORTHU.ARC (#2079). </p>

<p>To continue the previous comparison, here's the definition of MAX from
HENCE4TH [MIS90]. I omit the dictionary headers for clarity: </p>

<pre>_max() { 
    OVER  OVER  LESS IF  SWAP  ENDIF  DROP }
</pre>

<p>Instead of assembler, C is used to write the CODE words in the kernel.
For example, here is HENCE4TH's SWAP: </p>

<pre>_swap() { 
    register cell i = *(dsp);
    *(dsp) = *(dsp + 1);
    *(dsp + 1) = i;
}
</pre>

<p>(Please note: there is quite a variety of techniques for writing Forth
words in C, so these words may appear radically different in CFORTH or
TILE.) </p>

<p>On a 68000 or SPARC, this might produce quite good code. On a Z80 or
8051, quite the opposite. But even if you plan to write a Forth in C, you
need to understand how Forth works in assembler. So stay tuned for the
next installment of Moving Forth! </p>
