<h2 align="CENTER">Part 1: Design Decisions in the Forth Kernel</h2>

<h3 align="CENTER">by Brad Rodriguez</h3>

<p><font size="-1">This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.psyber.com/~tcj">The
Computer Journal</a> #59 (January/February 1993).</font></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>Everyone in the Forth community talks about how easy it is to port Forth
to a new CPU. But like many "easy" and "obvious" tasks,
not much is written on how to do it! So, when Bill Kibler suggested this
topic for an article, I decided to break with the great oral tradition
of Forthwrights, and document the process in black and white. </p>

<p>Over the course of these articles I will develop Forths for the 6809,
8051, and Z80. I'm doing the 6809 to illustrate an easy and conventional
Forth model; plus, I've already published a 6809 assembler [ROD91,ROD92],
and I'll be needing a 6809 Forth for future TCJ projects. I'm doing the
8051 Forth for a University project, but it also illustrates some rather
different design decisions. The Z80 Forth is for all the CP/M readers of
TCJ, and for some friends with TRS-80s gathering dust. </p>

<h2>THE ESSENTIAL HARDWARE </h2>

<p><u>You</u> must choose a CPU. I will not delve into the merits of one
CPU over another for Forth, since a CPU choice is usually forced upon you
by other considerations. Besides, the object of this article is to show
how to move Forth to <u>any</u> CPU. </p>

<p>You can expect the usual 16-bit Forth kernel (see below) to occupy about
8K bytes of program space. For a full kernel that can compile Forth definitions,
you should allow a minimum of 1K byte of RAM. To use Forth's block-management
system for disk storage, you should add 3 Kbytes or more for buffers. For
a 32-bit Forth model, double these numbers. </p>

<p>These are the <u>minimums</u> to get a Forth kernel up and running.
To run an application on your hardware, you should increase PROM and RAM
sizes to suit. </p>

<h2>16 OR 32 BIT? </h2>

<p>The word size used by Forth is not necessarily the same as that of the
CPU. The smallest practical Forth is a 16-bit model; i.e., one which uses
16-bit integers and 16-bit addresses. The Forth community calls this the
"cell" size, since "word" refers to a Forth definition.
</p>

<p>8-bit CPUs almost invariably support 16-bit Forths. This usually requires
explicit coding of double-byte arithmetic, although some 8-bit CPUs do
have a few 16-bit operations. </p>

<p>16-bit CPUs commonly run 16-bit Forths, although the same double- precision
techniques can be used to write a 32-bit Forth on a 16- bit CPU. At least
one 32-bit Forth has been written for the 8086/8088. </p>

<p>32-bit CPUs normally run 32-bit Forths. A smaller Forth model rarely
saves code length or processor time. However, I know of at least one 16-bit
Forth written for the 68000. This <u>does</u> shrink application code size
by a factor of two, since high-level Forth definitions become a string
of 16-bit addresses rather than a string of 32-bit addresses. (This will
become evident shortly.) Most 68000s, though, have plenty of RAM. </p>

<p>All of the examples described in this article are 16-bit Forths running
on 8-bit CPUs. </p>

<h2>THE THREADING TECHNIQUE </h2>

<p>"Threaded code" is the hallmark of Forth. A Forth "thread"
is just a list of addresses of routines to be executed. You can think of
this as a list of subroutine calls, with the CALL instructions removed.
Over the years many threading variations have been devised, and which one
is best depends upon the CPU and the application. To make a decision, you
need to understand how they work, and their tradeoffs. </p>

<h3>Indirect Threaded Code (ITC) </h3>

<p>This is the classical Forth threading technique, used in fig- Forth
and F83, and described in most books on Forth. All the other threading
schemes are "improvements" on this, so you need to understand
ITC to appreciate the others. </p>

<p>Let's look at the definition of a Forth word SQUARE: </p>

<pre><b>    </b>: SQUARE  DUP * ;
</pre>

<p>In a typical ITC Forth this would appear in memory as shown in Figure
1. (The header will be discussed in a future article; it holds housekeeping
information used for compilation, and isn't involved in threading.) </p>

<p><img src="./Moving Forth_ Part 1_files/mov1-1.gif" alt="Fig.1 Indirect Threaded Code" height="284" width="789">
</p>

<p>Assume SQUARE is encountered while executing some other Forth word.
Forth's Interpreter Pointer (IP) will be pointing to a cell in memory --
contained within that "other" word -- which contains the address
of the word SQUARE. (To be precise, that cell contains the address of SQUARE's
Code Field.) The interpreter fetches that address, and then uses it to
fetch the contents of SQUARE's Code Field. These contents are yet another
address -- the address of a machine language subroutine which performs
the word SQUARE. In pseudo-code, this is: </p>

<pre>   (IP) -&gt; W  fetch memory pointed by IP into "W" register
              ...W now holds address of the Code Field
   IP+2 -&gt; IP advance IP, just like a program counter
              (assuming 2-byte addresses in the thread)
   (W) -&gt;  X  fetch memory pointed by W into "X" register
              ...X now holds address of the machine code 
   JP (X)     jump to the address in the X register</pre>

<p>This illustrates an important but rarely-elucidated principle: <u>the
address of the Forth word just entered is kept in W.</u> CODE words don't
need this information, but all other kinds of Forth words do. </p>

<p>If SQUARE were written in machine code, this would be the end of the
story: that bit of machine code would be executed, and then jump back to
the Forth interpreter -- which, since IP was incremented, is pointing to
the <u>next</u> word to be executed. This is why the Forth interpreter
is usually called NEXT. </p>

<p>But, SQUARE is a high-level "colon" definition -- it holds
a "thread", a list of addresses. In order to perform this definition,
the Forth interpreter must be re-started at a new location: the Parameter
Field of SQUARE. Of course, the interpreter's old location must be saved,
to resume the "other" Forth word once SQUARE is finished. This
is just like a subroutine call! The machine language action of SQUARE is
simply to push the old IP, set IP to a new location, run the interpreter,
and when SQUARE is done pop the IP. (As you can see, the IP is the "program
counter" of high-level Forth.) This is called DOCOLON or ENTER in
various Forths: </p>

<pre>   PUSH IP     onto the "return address stack"
   W+2 -&gt; IP   W still points to the Code Field, so W+2 is 
               the address of the Body!  (Assuming a 2-byte
               address -- other Forths may be different.)
   JUMP to interpreter ("NEXT")</pre>

<p>This identical code fragment is used by all high-level (i.e., threaded)
Forth definitions! That's why a pointer to this code fragment, not the
fragment itself, is included in the Forth definition. Over hundreds of
definitions, the savings add up! And this is why it's called Indirect threading.
</p>

<p>The "return from subroutine" is the word EXIT, which gets
compiled when Forth sees ';'. (Some Forths call it ;S instead of EXIT.)
EXIT just executes a machine language routine which does the following:
</p>

<pre>   POP IP   from the "return address stack"
   JUMP to interpreter
</pre>

<p>Walk through a couple of nested Forth definitions, just to assure yourself
that this works. </p>

<p>Note the characteristics of ITC: <u>every</u> Forth word has a one-cell
Code Field. Colon definitions compile one cell for each word used in the
definition. And the Forth interpreter must actually perform a <u>double</u>
indirection to get the address of the next machine code to run (first through
IP, then through W). </p>

<p>ITC is neither the smallest nor the fastest threading technique. It
may be the simplest; although DTC (described next) is really no more complex.
So why are so many Forths indirect-threaded? Mainly because <u>previous</u>
Forths, used as models, were indirect- threaded. These days, DTC is becoming
more popular. </p>

<p>So when should ITC be used? Of the various techniques, ITC produces
the cleanest and most elegant definitions -- nothing but addresses. If
you're attuned to such considerations, ITC may appeal to you. If your code
fiddles around with the insides of definitions, the simplicity and uniformity
of the ITC representation may enhance portability. ITC is the classical
Forth model, so it may be preferred for education. Finally, on CPUs lacking
a subroutine call instruction -- such as the 1802 -- ITC is often more
efficient than DTC. </p>

<h3>Direct Threaded Code (DTC) </h3>

<p>Direct Threaded Code differs from ITC in only one respect: instead of
the Code Field containing the address of some machine code, <u>the Code
Field contains actual machine code itself.</u> </p>

<p>I'm not saying that the complete code for ENTER is contained in each
and every colon definition! In "high-level" Forth words, the
Code Field will contain <u>a subroutine call</u>, as shown in Figure 2.
Colon definitions, for instance, will contain a call to the ENTER routine.
</p>

<p><img src="./Moving Forth_ Part 1_files/mov1-2.gif" alt="Fig.2 Direct Threaded Code" height="285" width="758">
</p>

<p>The NEXT pseudo-code for direct threading is simply: </p>

<pre>   (IP) -&gt; W   fetch memory pointed by IP into "W" register
   IP+2 -&gt; IP  advance IP (assuming 2-byte addresses)
   JP (W)      jump to the address in the W register</pre>

<p>This gains speed: the interpreter now performs only a <u>single</u>
indirection. On the Z80 this reduces the NEXT routine -- the most-used
code fragment in the Forth kernel -- from eleven instructions to seven!
</p>

<p>This costs space: every high-level definition in a Z80 Forth (for example)
is now one byte longer, since a 2-byte address has been replaced by a 3-byte
call. But <u>this is not universally true.</u> A 32-bit 68000 Forth may
replace a 4-byte address with a 4-byte BSR instruction, for no net loss.
And on the Zilog Super8, which has machine instructions for DTC Forth,
the 2-byte address is replaced by a 1-byte ENTER instruction, making a
DTC Forth <u>smaller</u> on the Super8! </p>

<p>Of course, DTC CODE definitions are two bytes shorter, since they no
longer need a pointer at all! </p>

<p>I used to think that high-level definitions in DTC Forths required the
use of a subroutine call in the Code Field. Frank Sergeant's Pygmy Forth
[SER90] demonstrates that a simple jump can be used just as easily, and
will usually be faster. </p>

<p>Guy Kelly has compiled a superb review of Forth implementations for
the IBM PC [KEL92], which I strongly recommend to <u>all</u> Forth kernel
writers. Of the 19 Forths he studied, 10 used DTC, 7 used ITC, and 2 used
subroutine threading (discussed next). <u>I recommend the use of Direct-Threaded
Code over Indirect-Threaded Code for all new Forth kernels.</u> </p>

<h3>Jump to NEXT, or code it in-line? </h3>

<p>The Forth inner interpreter, NEXT, is a common routine to all CODE definitions.
You might keep just one copy of this common routine, and have all CODE
words jump to it. (Note that you Jump to NEXT; a subroutine Call is not
necessary.) </p>

<p>However, the speed of NEXT is crucial to the speed of the entire Forth
system. Also, on many CPUs, the NEXT routine is quite short; often only
two or three instructions. So it may be preferable to code NEXT in-line,
wherever it is used. This is frequently done by making NEXT an assembler
macro. </p>

<p>This is a simple speed vs. space decision: in-line NEXT is always faster,
but almost always larger. The total size increase is the number of extra
bytes required for in-line expansion, times the number of CODE words in
the system. Sometimes there's no tradeoff at all: in a 6809 DTC Forth,
an in-line NEXT is <u>shorter</u> than a Jump instruction! </p>

<h3>Subroutine Threaded Code (STC) </h3>

<p>A high-level Forth definition is nothing but a list of subroutines to
be executed. You don't need interpreters to accomplish this; you can get
the same effect by simply stringing a list of subroutine calls together:
</p>

<pre>SQUARE: CALL DUP
        CALL *     ; or a suitable alphanumeric name
        RET
</pre>

<p>See Figure 3. This representation of Forth words has been used as a
starting point to explain Forth threading techniques to assembly language
programmers [KOG82]. </p>

<p><img src="./Moving Forth_ Part 1_files/mov1-3.gif" alt="Fig.3 Subroutine Threaded Code" height="223" width="706">
</p>

<p>STC is an elegant representation; colon definitions and CODE words are
now identical. "Defined words" (VARIABLEs, CONSTANTs, and the
like) are handled the same as in DTC -- the Code Field begins with a jump
or call to some machine code elsewhere. </p>

<p>The major disadvantage is that subroutine calls are usually larger than
simple addresses. On the Z80, for example, the size of colon definitions
increases by 50% -- and most of your application is colon definitions!
Contrariwise, on a 32-bit 68000 there may be no size increase at all, when
4-byte addresses are replaced with 4-byte BSRs. (But if your code size
exceeds 64K, some of those addresses must be replaced with 6-byte JSRs.)
</p>

<p>Subroutine threading <u>may</u> be faster than direct threading. You
save time by not having an interpreter, but you lose time because <u>every</u>
reference to a Forth word involves a push and pop of a return address.
In a DTC Forth, only high-level words cause activity on the return stack.
On the 6809 or Zilog Super8, DTC is faster than STC. </p>

<p>There is another advantage to STC: it dispenses with the IP register.
Some processors -- like the 8051 -- are desperately short of addressing
registers. Eliminating the IP can really simplify and speed up the kernel!
</p>

<p><u>The only way to know for sure is to write sample code.</u> This is
intimately involved with register selection, discussed in the next section.
</p>

<h3>STC with in-line expansion; optimization; direct compilation </h3>

<p>On older and 8-bit CPUs, almost every Forth primitive involves several
machine instructions. But on more powerful CPUs, many Forth primitives
are written in a single instruction. For example, on the 32-bit 68000,
DROP is simply </p>

<pre>   ADDQ #4,An     where An is Forth's PSP register
</pre>

<p>In a subroutine-threaded Forth, using DROP in a colon definition would
result in the sequence </p>

<pre>   BSR ...
   BSR DROP  -------&gt;   DROP: ADDQ #4,An
   BSR ...   &lt;-------         RTS
</pre>

<p>ADDQ is a two-byte instruction. Why write a four-byte subroutine call
to a two-byte instruction? No matter how many times DROP is used, there's
no savings! The code is smaller and faster if the ADDQ is coded directly
into the stream of BSRs. Some Forth compilers do this "in-line expansion"
of CODE words [CUR93a]. </p>

<p>The disadvantage of in-line expansion is that decompiling back to the
original source code becomes very difficult. As long as subroutine calls
are used, you still have pointers (the subroutine addresses) to the Forth
words comprising the thread. With pointers to the words, you can obtain
their names. But once a word is expanded into in-line code, all knowledge
of where that code came from is lost. </p>

<p>The advantage of in-line expansion -- aside from speed and size -- is
the potential for code optimization. For example, the Forth sequence </p>

<pre>   3 +  </pre>

<p>would be compiled in 68000 STC as </p>

<pre>   BSR LIT
   .DW  3 
   BSR PLUS
</pre>

<p>but could be expanded in-line as a <u>single</u> machine instruction!
</p>

<p>Optimizing Forth compilers is too broad a topic for this article. This
is an active area of Forth language research; see, for instance, [SCO89]
and [CUR93b]. The final culmination of optimized STC is a Forth which compiles
to "pure" machine code, just like a C or Fortran compiler. </p>

<h3>Token Threaded Code (TTC) </h3>

<p>DTC and STC aim to improve the speed of Forth programs, at some cost
in memory. Now let's move the <u>other</u> direction from ITC, toward something
slower but smaller. </p>

<p>The purpose of a Forth thread is to specify a list of Forth words (subroutines)
to be performed. Suppose a 16-bit Forth system only had a maximum of 256
different words. Then each word could be uniquely identified by an 8-bit
number. Instead of a list of 16-bit addresses, you would have a list of
8-bit identifiers or "tokens," and the size of the colon definitions
would be halved! </p>

<p>A token-threaded Forth keeps a table of addresses of all Forth words,
as shown in Figure 4. The token value is then used to index into this table,
to find the Forth word corresponding to a given token. This <u>adds</u>
one level of indirection to the Forth interpreter, so it is slower than
an "address-threaded" Forth. </p>

<p><img src="./Moving Forth_ Part 1_files/mov1-4.gif" alt="Fig.4 Token Threaded Code" height="228" width="790">
</p>

<p>The principal advantage of token-threaded Forths is small size. TTC
is most commonly seen in handheld computers and other severely size-constrained
applications. Also, the table of "entry points" into all the
Forth words can simplify linkage of separately-compiled modules. </p>

<p>The disadvantage of TTC is speed: TTC makes the slowest Forths. Also,
the TTC compiler is slightly more complex. If you need more than 256 Forth
words, it's necessary to have some open-ended encoding scheme to mix 8-bit
and larger tokens. </p>

<p>I can envision a 32-bit Forth using 16-bit tokens, but how many 32-bit
systems are size-constrained? </p>

<h3>Segment Threaded Code </h3>

<p>Since there are so many 8086 derivatives in the world, segment threading
deserves a brief mention. Instead of using "normal" byte addresses
within a 64K segment, <u>paragraph</u> addresses are used. (A "paragraph"
is 16 bytes in the 8086.) Then, the interpreter can load these addresses
into segment registers, instead of into the usual address registers. This
allows a 16- bit Forth model to efficiently access the full megabyte of
8086 memory. </p>

<p>The principal disadvantage of segment threading is the 16-byte "granularity"
of the memory space. Every Forth word must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary.
If Forth words have random lengths, an average of 8 bytes will be wasted
per Forth word. </p>

<h2>REGISTER ALLOCATION </h2>

<p>Next to the threading technique, the usage of the CPU's registers is
the most crucial design decision. It's probably the most difficult. The
availability of CPU registers can determine what threading technique can
be used, and even what the memory map will be! </p>

<h3>The Classical Forth Registers </h3>

<p>The classical Forth model has five "virtual registers." These
are abstract entities which are used in the primitive operations of Forth.
NEXT, ENTER, and EXIT were defined earlier in terms of these abstract registers.
</p>

<p>Each of these is one cell wide -- i.e., in a 16-bit Forth, these are
16-bit registers. (There are exceptions to this rule, as you will see later.)
These <u>may not all be CPU registers.</u> If your CPU doesn't have enough
registers, some of these can be kept in memory. I'll describe them in the
order of their importance; i.e., the bottom of this list are the best candidates
to be stored in memory. </p>

<p><b>W</b> is the Working register. It is used for many things, including
memory reference, so it should be an address register; i.e., you must be
able to fetch and store memory using the contents of W as the address.
You also need to be able to do arithmetic on W. (In DTC Forths, you must
also be able to jump indirect using W.) W is used by the interpreter <u>in
every Forth word</u>. In a CPU having only one register, you would use
it for W and keep everything else in memory (and the system would be incredibly
slow). </p>

<p><b>IP</b> is the Interpreter Pointer. This is used by <u>every Forth
word</u> (through NEXT, ENTER, or EXIT). IP must be an address register.
You also need to be able to increment IP. Subroutine threaded Forths don't
need this register. </p>

<p><b>PSP</b> is the Parameter Stack (or "data stack") Pointer,
sometimes called simply SP. I prefer PSP because SP is frequently the name
of a CPU register, and they shouldn't be confused. Most CODE words use
this. PSP must be a stack pointer, or an address register which can be
incremented and decremented. It's also a plus if you can do indexed addressing
from PSP. </p>

<p><b>RSP</b> is the Return Stack Pointer, sometimes called simply RP.
This is used by colon definitions in ITC and DTC Forths, and by <u>all</u>
words in STC Forths. RSP must be a stack pointer, or an address register
which can be incremented and decremented. </p>

<p>If <u>at all possible</u>, put W, IP, PSP, and RSP in registers. The
virtual registers that follow can be kept in memory, but there is usually
a speed advantage to keeping them in CPU registers. </p>

<p><b>X</b> is a working register, <u>not</u> considered one of the "classical"
Forth registers, even though the classical ITC Forths need it for the second
indirection. In ITC you must be able to jump indirect using X. X may also
be used by a few CODE words to do arithmetic and such. This is particularly
important on processors that cannot use memory as an operand. For example,
ADD on a Z80 might be (in pseudo-code) </p>

<pre>   POP W   POP X   X+W -&gt; W   PUSH W </pre>

<p>Sometimes another working register, Y, is also defined. </p>

<p><b>UP</b> is the User Pointer, holding the base address of the task's
user area. UP is usually added to an offset, and used by high-level Forth
code, so it can be just stored somewhere. But if the CPU can do indexed
addressing from the UP register, CODE words can more easily and quickly
access user variables. If you have a surplus of address registers, use
one for UP. Single-task Forths don't need UP. </p>

<p>X -- if needed -- is more important to keep in register than UP. UP
is the easiest of the Forth virtual registers to move into memory. </p>

<h3>Use of the Hardware Stack </h3>

<p>Most CPUs have a stack pointer as part of their hardware, used by interrupts
and subroutine calls. How does this map into the Forth registers? Should
it be the PSP or the RSP? </p>

<p>The short answer is, <u>it depends</u>. It is said that the PSP is used
more than the RSP in ITC and DTC Forths. If your CPU has few address registers,
and PUSH and POP are faster than explicit reference, use the hardware stack
as the Parameter Stack. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if your CPU is rich in addressing modes -- and allows
indexed addressing -- there's a plus in having the PSP as a general-purpose
address register. In this case, use the hardware stack as the Return Stack.
</p>

<p>Sometimes you do neither! The TMS320C25's hardware stack is only eight
cells deep -- all but useless for Forth. So its hardware stack is used
<u>only</u> for interrupts, and both PSP and RSP are general-purpose address
registers. (ANS Forth specifies a minimum of 32 cells of Parameter Stack
and 24 cells of Return Stack; I prefer 64 cells of each.) </p>

<p>You will occasionally encounter the dogma that the hardware stack "must
be" the Parameter Stack, or "must be" the Return Stack.
Instead, code some sample Forth primitives, such as </p>

<pre>   SWAP  OVER  @  !  +  0=  </pre>

<p>and see which approach is smaller or faster. (DUP and DROP, by the way,
are no test -- they're usually trivial.) </p>

<p>Occasionally you reach strange conclusions! Gary Bergstrom has pointed
out that a 6809 DTC Forth can be made a few cycles faster by using the
6809 user stack pointer as the <u>IP</u>; NEXT becomes a POP. He uses an
index register for one of Forth's stacks. </p>

<h3>Top-Of-Stack in Register </h3>

<p>Forth's performance can be improved considerably by keeping the top
element of the Parameter Stack in a register! Many Forth words (such as
0=) then don't need to use the stack. Other words still do the same number
of pushes and pops, only in a different place in the code. Only a few Forth
words (DROP and 2DROP) become more complicated, since you can no longer
simply adjust the stack pointer -- you have to update the TOS register
as well. </p>

<p>There are a few rules when writing CODE words: </p>

<p>A word which <u>removes</u> items from the stack must pop the "new"
TOS into its register. </p>

<p>A word which <u>adds</u> items to the stack must push the "old"
TOS onto the stack (unless, of course, it's consumed by the word). </p>

<p><u>If you have at least six cell-size CPU registers, I recommend keeping
the TOS in a register.</u> I consider TOS more important than UP to have
in register, but less important than W, IP, PSP, and RSP. (TOS in register
performs many of the functions of the X register.) It's useful if this
register can perform memory addressing. PDP-11s, Z8s, and 68000s are good
candidates. </p>

<p>Nine of the 19 IBM PC Forths studied by Guy Kelly [KEL92] keep TOS in
register. </p>

<p>I think this innovation has been resisted because of the false beliefs
that a) it adds instructions, and b) the top stack element must be accessible
as memory. It turns out that even such words as PICK, ROLL, and DEPTH are
trivially modified for TOS-in-register. </p>

<p>What about buffering <u>two</u> stack elements in registers? When you
keep the top of stack in a register, the total number of operations performed
remains essentially the same. A push remains a push, regardless of whether
it is before or after the operation you're performing. On the other hand,
buffering two stack elements in registers <u>adds</u> a large number of
instructions -- a push becomes a push followed by a move. Only dedicated
Forth processors like the RTX2000 and fantastically clever optimizing compilers
can benefit from buffering two stack elements in registers. </p>

<h3>Some examples </h3>

CPUs. Try to deduce the design decisions of the authors from this list.

<p>"SP" refers to the hardware stack pointer. "Zpage"
refers to values kept in the 6502's memory page zero, which are almost
as useful as -- sometimes more useful than -- values kept in registers;
e.g., they can be used for memory addressing. "Fixed" means that
Payne's 8051 Forth has a single, immovable user area, and UP is a hard-coded
constant. </p>

<h3>Narrow Registers </h3>

<p>Notice anything odd in the previous list? The 6502 Forth -- a 16-bit
model -- uses <u>8-bit</u> stack pointers! </p>

<p>It is possible to make PSP, RSP, and UP smaller than the cell size of
the Forth. This is because the stacks and user area are both relatively
small areas of memory. Each stack may be as small as 64 cells in length,
and the user area rarely exceeds 128 cells. You simply need to ensure that
either a) these data areas are confined to a small area of memory, so a
short address can be used, or b) the high address bits are provided in
some other way, e.g., a memory page select. </p>

<p>In the 6502, the hardware stack is confined to page one of RAM (addresses
01xxh) by the design of the CPU. The 8-bit stack pointer can be used for
the Return Stack. The Parameter Stack is kept in page zero of RAM, which
can be indirectly accessed by the 8-bit index register X. (Question for
the advanced student: why use the 6502's X, and not Y? Hint: look at the
addressing modes available.) </p>

<p>In the 8051, you can use the 8-bit registers R0 and R1 to address external
RAM, provided that you explicitly output the high 8 bits of address to
port 2. This allows a "page select" for two stacks. </p>

<p>UP is different from PSP and RSP: it simply provides a base address;
it is never incremented or decremented. So it's practical to supply only
the <u>high</u> bits of this virtual register. The low bits must then be
provided by whatever indexed addressing technique is used. For example,
on the 6809, you can use the DP register to hold the high 8 bits of UP,
and then use Direct Page addressing to access any of the 256 locations
in this page. This forces all user areas to begin on an address xx00h,
which is no great hardship, and limits the user area to 128 cells in length.
</p>

<p>On the 8086 you could conceivably use a segment register to specify
the base address of the user area. </p>
