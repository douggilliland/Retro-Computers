# About the Sample Code

Sample code is provided in the [src](../src) folder, with one file corresponding to each chapter.

The code is based on Ben Eater's code, and can be assembled with the same kind of command:

    vasm6502-oldstyle -Fbin -dotdir <filename>

I'm using local labels, but hopefully it's clear enough how they work - if not, refer to the
vasm documentation.

The LCD control code is Ben's and won't be discussed here.
