I am happy to announce that Planck 6502 is now Open Hardware Certified.

And it has the badge to prove it:

This is the 13th proect from France that the OSHW has certified. I'm not sure if that means good luck or bad luck (probably no influence at all on luck, but I guess time will tell :D)

Anyway I am pretty happy to be certified.
