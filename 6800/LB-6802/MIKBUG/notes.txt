MIKBUG and MINIBUG are ROM monitors for the 6800 from Motorola. Mike Holley at swtpc.com,
http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/MP_A/MIKBUG_Index.htm has a Motorola 
"Engineering Note 100 MCM6830L7 MIKBUG" PDF document and MIKBUG source. 
The Note has listings for MIKBUG and MINIBUG. I'm guessing "MIK" is Mike Wiles, an author of the Note.

From Mike Lee in Feb-April 2019, I obtained a varient of MIKBUG, which replaces the PIA parallel keyboard input with an ACIA serial input. I've renamed these MIKSBUG, .S19 and
.ASM files.
