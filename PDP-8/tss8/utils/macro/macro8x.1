.SH NAME
macro8x \- PDP8 macro assembler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B macro8x [ -d -m -p -r -x ] inputfile inputfile...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B macro8x
command.
This is a cross-assembler to for PDP/8 assembly language programs.
It will produce an output file in bin format, rim format, and using the
appropriate pseudo-ops, a combination of rim and bin formats.
A listing file is always produced and with an optional symbol table
and/or a symbol cross-reference (concordance).  The permanent symbol
table can be output in a form that may be read back in so a customized
permanent symbol table can be produced.  Any detected errors are output
to a separate file giving the filename in which they were detected
along with the line number, column number and error message as well as
marking the error in the listing file.
.br
The following file name extensions are used:
.br
   .pal    source code (input)
.br
   .lst    assembly listing (output)
.br
   .bin    assembly output in DEC's bin format (output)
.br
   .rim    assembly output in DEC's rim format (output)
.br
   .err    assembly errors detected (if any) (output)
.br
   .prm    permanent symbol table in form suitable for reading after   the EXPUNGE pseudo-op.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.br
   -d   Dump the symbol table at end of assembly 
.br
   -m   Print macro expansions.
.br
   -p   Generate a file with the permanent symbols in it.
.br
        (To get the current symbol table, assemble a file than has only
.br
        a $ in it.)
.br
   -r   Produce output in rim format (default is bin format)
.br
   -x   Generate a cross-reference (concordance) of user symbols.
.PP
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Assembler error diagnostics are output to an error file and inserted
in the listing file.  Each line in the error file has the form
.PP
   <filename>(<line>:<col>) : error:  <message> at Loc = <loc>
.PP
An example error message is:
.PP
   bintst.pal(17:9) : error:  undefined symbol "UNDEF" at Loc = 07616
.PP
The error diagnostics put in the listing start with a two character
error code (if appropriate) and a short message.  A carat '^' is
placed under the item in error if appropriate.
.PP
An example error message is:
.PP
.BR
   17 07616 3000          DCA     UNDEF
.BR
   UD undefined                   ^
.BR
   18 07617 1777          TAD  I  DUMMY
.BR
.PP
When an indirect is generated, an at character '@' is placed after the
the instruction value in the listing as an indicator as follows:
.PP
   14 03716 1777@         TAD     OFFPAG
.PP
Undefined symbols are marked in the symbol table listing by prepending
a '?' to the symbol.  Redefined symbols are marked in the symbol table
listing by prepending a '#' to the symbol.  Examples are:
.PP
   #REDEF   04567
.BR
    SWITCH  07612
.BR
   ?UNDEF   00000
.PP
Refer to the (source) code for the diagnostic messages generated.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Only a minimal effort has been made to keep the listing format
anything like the PAL-8 listing format.
The operation of the conditional assembly pseudo-ops may not function
exactly as the DEC versions.  I did not have any examples of these so
the implementation is my interpretation of how they should work.
.PP
The RIMPUNch and BINPUNch pseudo-ops do not change the binary output
file type that was specified on startup.  This was intentional and
allows rim formatted data to be output prior to the actual binary
formatted data.  On UN*X style systems, the same effect can be achieved
by using the "cat" command, but on DOS/Windows systems, doing this was
a major chore.
.PP
The floating point input does not generate values exactly as the DEC
compiler does.  I worked out several examples by hand and believe that 
this implementation is slightly more accurate.  If I am mistaken,
let me know and, if possible, a better method of generating the values.
.PP
.SH HISTORICAL NOTE
.PP
This assembler was written to support the fleet of PDP-8 systems
used by the Bay Area Rapid Transit System.  As of early 1997,
this includes about 40 PDP-8/E systems driving the train destination
signs in passenger stations.
